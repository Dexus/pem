## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.**
This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

You can report a vulnerability
- via our [security advisory](https://github.com/Dexus/pem/security/advisories/new) following [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) 
- email to github@josef-froehle.de

You will receive feedback typically within 72h.
