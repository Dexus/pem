SESS_ID(1)                          OpenSSL                         SESS_ID(1)



NAME
       openssl-sess_id, sess_id - SSL/TLS session handling utility

SYNOPSIS
       openssl sess_id [-help] [-inform PEM|DER] [-outform PEM|DER|NSS] [-in
       filename] [-out filename] [-text] [-noout] [-context ID]

DESCRIPTION
       The sess_id process the encoded version of the SSL session structure
       and optionally prints out SSL session details (for example the SSL
       session master key) in human readable format. Since this is a
       diagnostic tool that needs some knowledge of the SSL protocol to use
       properly, most users will not need to use it.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM
           This specifies the input format. The DER option uses an ASN1 DER
           encoded format containing session details. The precise format can
           vary from one version to the next.  The PEM form is the default
           format: it consists of the DER format base64 encoded with
           additional header and footer lines.

       -outform DER|PEM|NSS
           This specifies the output format. The PEM and DER options have the
           same meaning and default as the -inform option. The NSS option
           outputs the session id and the master key in NSS keylog format.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read session information from
           or standard input by default.

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write session information to
           or standard output if this option is not specified.

       -text
           Prints out the various public or private key components in plain
           text in addition to the encoded version.

       -cert
           If a certificate is present in the session it will be output using
           this option, if the -text option is also present then it will be
           printed out in text form.

       -noout
           This option prevents output of the encoded version of the session.

       -context ID
           This option can set the session id so the output session
           information uses the supplied ID. The ID can be any string of
           characters. This option won't normally be used.

OUTPUT
       Typical output:

        SSL-Session:
            Protocol  : TLSv1
            Cipher    : 0016
            Session-ID: 871E62626C554CE95488823752CBD5F3673A3EF3DCE9C67BD916C809914B40ED
            Session-ID-ctx: 01000000
            Master-Key: A7CEFC571974BE02CAC305269DC59F76EA9F0B180CB6642697A68251F2D2BB57E51DBBB4C7885573192AE9AEE220FACD
            Key-Arg   : None
            Start Time: 948459261
            Timeout   : 300 (sec)
            Verify return code 0 (ok)

       These are described below in more detail.

       Protocol
           This is the protocol in use TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1, TLSv1 or
           SSLv3.

       Cipher
           The cipher used this is the actual raw SSL or TLS cipher code, see
           the SSL or TLS specifications for more information.

       Session-ID
           The SSL session ID in hex format.

       Session-ID-ctx
           The session ID context in hex format.

       Master-Key
           This is the SSL session master key.

       Start Time
           This is the session start time represented as an integer in
           standard Unix format.

       Timeout
           The timeout in seconds.

       Verify return code
           This is the return code when an SSL client certificate is verified.

NOTES
       The PEM encoded session format uses the header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN SSL SESSION PARAMETERS-----
        -----END SSL SESSION PARAMETERS-----

       Since the SSL session output contains the master key it is possible to
       read the contents of an encrypted session using this information.
       Therefore, appropriate security precautions should be taken if the
       information is being output by a "real" application. This is however
       strongly discouraged and should only be used for debugging purposes.

BUGS
       The cipher and start time should be printed out in human readable form.
