NAME
       openssl-speed, speed - test library performance

SYNOPSIS
       openssl speed [-help] [-engine id] [-elapsed] [-evp algo] [-decrypt]
       [-rand file...]  [-writerand file] [-primes num] [-seconds num] [-bytes
       num] [algorithm...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to test the performance of cryptographic
       algorithms.  To see the list of supported algorithms, use the list
       --digest-commands or list --cipher-commands command. The global CSPRNG
       is denoted by the rand algorithm name.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -engine id
           Specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause speed to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms.

       -elapsed
           When calculating operations- or bytes-per-second, use wall-clock
           time instead of CPU user time as divisor. It can be useful when
           testing speed of hardware engines.

       -evp algo
           Use the specified cipher or message digest algorithm via the EVP
           interface.  If algo is an AEAD cipher, then you can pass <-aead> to
           benchmark a TLS-like sequence. And if algo is a multi-buffer
           capable cipher, e.g.  aes-128-cbc-hmac-sha1, then -mb will time
           multi-buffer operation.

       -decrypt
           Time the decryption instead of encryption. Affects only the EVP
           testing.

       -rand file...
           A file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator.  Multiple files can be specified separated by an
           OS-dependent character.  The separator is ; for MS-Windows, , for
           OpenVMS, and : for all others.

       [-writerand file]
           Writes random data to the specified file upon exit.  This can be
           used with a subsequent -rand flag.

       -primes num
           Generate a num-prime RSA key and use it to run the benchmarks. This
           option is only effective if RSA algorithm is specified to test.

       -seconds num
           Run benchmarks for num seconds.

       -bytes num
           Run benchmarks on num-byte buffers. Affects ciphers, digests and
           the CSPRNG.

       [zero or more test algorithms]
           If any options are given, speed tests those algorithms, otherwise a
           pre-compiled grand selection is tested.
