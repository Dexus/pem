NAME
       openssl - OpenSSL command line tool

SYNOPSIS
       openssl command [ command_opts ] [ command_args ]

       openssl list [ standard-commands | digest-commands | cipher-commands |
       cipher-algorithms | digest-algorithms | public-key-algorithms]

       openssl no-XXX [ arbitrary options ]

DESCRIPTION
       OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
       (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) network protocols and
       related cryptography standards required by them.

       The openssl program is a command line tool for using the various
       cryptography functions of OpenSSL's crypto library from the shell.  It
       can be used for

        o  Creation and management of private keys, public keys and parameters
        o  Public key cryptographic operations
        o  Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
        o  Calculation of Message Digests
        o  Encryption and Decryption with Ciphers
        o  SSL/TLS Client and Server Tests
        o  Handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
        o  Time Stamp requests, generation and verification

COMMAND SUMMARY
       The openssl program provides a rich variety of commands (command in the
       SYNOPSIS above), each of which often has a wealth of options and
       arguments (command_opts and command_args in the SYNOPSIS).

       Detailed documentation and use cases for most standard subcommands are
       available (e.g., x509(1) or openssl-x509(1)).

       Many commands use an external configuration file for some or all of
       their arguments and have a -config option to specify that file.  The
       environment variable OPENSSL_CONF can be used to specify the location
       of the file.  If the environment variable is not specified, then the
       file is named openssl.cnf in the default certificate storage area,
       whose value depends on the configuration flags specified when the
       OpenSSL was built.

       The list parameters standard-commands, digest-commands, and cipher-
       commands output a list (one entry per line) of the names of all
       standard commands, message digest commands, or cipher commands,
       respectively, that are available in the present openssl utility.

       The list parameters cipher-algorithms and digest-algorithms list all
       cipher and message digest names, one entry per line. Aliases are listed
       as:

        from => to

       The list parameter public-key-algorithms lists all supported public key
       algorithms.

       The command no-XXX tests whether a command of the specified name is
       available.  If no command named XXX exists, it returns 0 (success) and
       prints no-XXX; otherwise it returns 1 and prints XXX.  In both cases,
       the output goes to stdout and nothing is printed to stderr.  Additional
       command line arguments are always ignored.  Since for each cipher there
       is a command of the same name, this provides an easy way for shell
       scripts to test for the availability of ciphers in the openssl program.
       (no-XXX is not able to detect pseudo-commands such as quit, list, or
       no-XXX itself.)

           but internally uses mostly all functionality of the OpenSSL ssl
           library.  It provides both an own command line oriented protocol

OPTIONS
       Details of which options are available depend on the specific command.
       This section describes some common options with common behavior.

   Common Options
       -help
           Provides a terse summary of all options.

   Pass Phrase Options
       Several commands accept password arguments, typically using -passin and
       -passout for input and output passwords respectively. These allow the
       password to be obtained from a variety of sources. Both of these
       options take a single argument whose format is described below. If no
       password argument is given and a password is required then the user is
       prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the current
       terminal with echoing turned off.

       Note that character encoding may be relevant, please see
       passphrase-encoding(7).

       pass:password
           The actual password is password. Since the password is visible to
           utilities (like 'ps' under Unix) this form should only be used
           where security is not important.

       env:var
           Obtain the password from the environment variable var. Since the
           environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms
           (e.g. ps under certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with
           caution.

       file:pathname
           The first line of pathname is the password. If the same pathname
           argument is supplied to -passin and -passout arguments then the
           first line will be used for the input password and the next line
           for the output password. pathname need not refer to a regular file:
           it could for example refer to a device or named pipe.

       fd:number
           Read the password from the file descriptor number. This can be used
           to send the data via a pipe for example.

       stdin
           Read the password from standard input.
