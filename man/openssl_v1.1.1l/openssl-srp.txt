NAME
       openssl-srp, srp - maintain SRP password file

SYNOPSIS
       openssl srp [-help] [-verbose] [-add] [-modify] [-delete] [-list]
       [-name section] [-config file] [-srpvfile file] [-gn identifier]
       [-userinfo text...]  [-passin arg] [-passout arg] [user...]

DESCRIPTION
       The srp command is user to maintain an SRP (secure remote password)
       file.  At most one of the -add, -modify, -delete, and -list options can
       be specified.  These options take zero or more usernames as parameters
       and perform the appropriate operation on the SRP file.  For -list, if
       no user is given then all users are displayed.

       The configuration file to use, and the section within the file, can be
       specified with the -config and -name flags, respectively.  If the
       config file is not specified, the -srpvfile can be used to just specify
       the file to operate on.

       The -userinfo option specifies additional information to add when
       adding or modifying a user.

       The -gn flag specifies the g and N values, using one of the strengths
       defined in IETF RFC 5054.

       The -passin and -passout arguments are parsed as described in the
       openssl(1) command.

OPTIONS
       [-help]
           Display an option summary.

       [-verbose]
           Generate verbose output while processing.
