CRL(1)                              OpenSSL                             CRL(1)



NAME
       openssl-crl, crl - CRL utility

SYNOPSIS
       openssl crl [-help] [-inform PEM|DER] [-outform PEM|DER] [-text] [-in
       filename] [-out filename] [-nameopt option] [-noout] [-hash] [-issuer]
       [-lastupdate] [-nextupdate] [-CAfile file] [-CApath dir]

DESCRIPTION
       The crl command processes CRL files in DER or PEM format.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM
           This specifies the input format. DER format is DER encoded CRL
           structure. PEM (the default) is a base64 encoded version of the DER
           form with header and footer lines.

       -outform DER|PEM
           This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning
           and default as the -inform option.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read from or standard input if
           this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           Specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
           default.

       -text
           Print out the CRL in text form.

       -nameopt option
           Option which determines how the subject or issuer names are
           displayed. See the description of -nameopt in x509(1).

       -noout
           Don't output the encoded version of the CRL.

       -hash
           Output a hash of the issuer name. This can be use to lookup CRLs in
           a directory by issuer name.

       -hash_old
           Outputs the "hash" of the CRL issuer name using the older algorithm
           as used by OpenSSL before version 1.0.0.

       -issuer
           Output the issuer name.

       -lastupdate
           Output the lastUpdate field.

       -nextupdate
           Output the nextUpdate field.

       -CAfile file
           Verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate
           in file.

       -CApath dir
           Verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate
           in dir. This directory must be a standard certificate directory:
           that is a hash of each subject name (using x509 -hash) should be
           linked to each certificate.

NOTES
       The PEM CRL format uses the header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN X509 CRL-----
        -----END X509 CRL-----

EXAMPLES
       Convert a CRL file from PEM to DER:

        openssl crl -in crl.pem -outform DER -out crl.der

       Output the text form of a DER encoded certificate:

        openssl crl -in crl.der -inform DER -text -noout

BUGS
       Ideally it should be possible to create a CRL using appropriate options
       and files too.
