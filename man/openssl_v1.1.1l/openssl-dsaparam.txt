NAME
       openssl-dsaparam, dsaparam - DSA parameter manipulation and generation

SYNOPSIS
       openssl dsaparam [-help] [-inform DER|PEM] [-outform DER|PEM] [-in
       filename] [-out filename] [-noout] [-text] [-C] [-rand file...]
       [-writerand file] [-genkey] [-engine id] [numbits]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to manipulate or generate DSA parameter files.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM
           This specifies the input format. The DER option uses an ASN1 DER
           encoded form compatible with RFC2459 (PKIX) DSS-Parms that is a
           SEQUENCE consisting of p, q and g respectively. The PEM form is the
           default format: it consists of the DER format base64 encoded with
           additional header and footer lines.

       -outform DER|PEM
           This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning
           and default as the -inform option.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read parameters from or
           standard input if this option is not specified. If the numbits
           parameter is included then this option will be ignored.

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename parameters to. Standard output
           is used if this option is not present. The output filename should
           not be the same as the input filename.

       -noout
           This option inhibits the output of the encoded version of the
           parameters.

       -text
           This option prints out the DSA parameters in human readable form.

       -C  This option converts the parameters into C code. The parameters can
           then be loaded by calling the get_dsaXXX() function.

       -genkey
           This option will generate a DSA either using the specified or
           generated parameters.

       -rand file...
           A file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator.  Multiple files can be specified separated by an
           OS-dependent character.  The separator is ; for MS-Windows, , for
           OpenVMS, and : for all others.

       [-writerand file]
           Writes random data to the specified file upon exit.  This can be
           used with a subsequent -rand flag.

       numbits
           This option specifies that a parameter set should be generated of
           size numbits. It must be the last option. If this option is
           included then the input file (if any) is ignored.

       -engine id
           Specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause dsaparam
           to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified
           engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set
           as the default for all available algorithms.

NOTES
       PEM format DSA parameters use the header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN DSA PARAMETERS-----
        -----END DSA PARAMETERS-----

       DSA parameter generation is a slow process and as a result the same set
       of DSA parameters is often used to generate several distinct keys.
