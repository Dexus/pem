PKEY(1)                             OpenSSL                            PKEY(1)



NAME
       openssl-pkey, pkey - public or private key processing tool

SYNOPSIS
       openssl pkey [-inform PEM|DER] [-outform PEM|DER] [-in filename]
       [-passin arg] [-out filename] [-passout arg] [-cipher] [-text]
       [-text_pub] [-noout] [-pubin] [-pubout] [-engine id]

DESCRIPTION
       The pkey command processes public or private keys. They can be
       converted between various forms and their components printed out.

COMMAND OPTIONS
       -inform DER|PEM
           This specifies the input format DER or PEM.

       -outform DER|PEM
           This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning
           as the -inform option.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard
           input if this option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a
           pass phrase will be prompted for.

       -passin arg
           the input file password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard
           output if this option is not specified. If any encryption options
           are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for. The output
           filename should not be the same as the input filename.

       -passout password
           the output file password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -cipher
           These options encrypt the private key with the supplied cipher. Any
           algorithm name accepted by EVP_get_cipherbyname() is acceptable
           such as des3.

       -text
           prints out the various public or private key components in plain
           text in addition to the encoded version.

       -text_pub
           print out only public key components even if a private key is being
           processed.

       -noout
           do not output the encoded version of the key.

       -pubin
           by default a private key is read from the input file: with this
           option a public key is read instead.

       -pubout
           by default a private key is output: with this option a public key
           will be output instead. This option is automatically set if the
           input is a public key.

       -engine id
           specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause pkey to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the pass phrase on an RSA private key:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -out keyout.pem

       To encrypt a private key using triple DES:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -des3 -out keyout.pem

       To convert a private key from PEM to DER format:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -outform DER -out keyout.der

       To print out the components of a private key to standard output:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -text -noout

       To print out the public components of a private key to standard output:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -text_pub -noout

       To just output the public part of a private key:

        openssl pkey -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem
