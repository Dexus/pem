       The ss__ttiimmee command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects
       to a remote host using SSL/TLS. It can request a page from the server
       and includes the time to transfer the payload data in its timing
       measurements. It measures the number of connections within a given
       timeframe, the amount of data transferred (if any), and calculates the
       average time spent for one connection.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ccoonnnneecctt hhoosstt::ppoorrtt
           This specifies the host and optional port to connect to.

       --wwwwww ppaaggee
           This specifies the page to GET from the server. A value of '/' gets
           the index.htm[l] page. If this parameter is not specified, then
           ss__ttiimmee will only perform the handshake to establish SSL connections
           but not transfer any payload data.

       --cceerrtt cceerrttnnaammee
           The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server. The
           default is not to use a certificate. The file is in PEM format.

       --kkeeyy kkeeyyffiillee
           The private key to use. If not specified then the certificate file
           will be used. The file is in PEM format.

       --vveerriiffyy ddeepptthh
           The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length of the
           server certificate chain and turns on server certificate
           verification.  Currently the verify operation continues after
           errors so all the problems with a certificate chain can be seen. As
           a side effect the connection will never fail due to a server
           certificate verify failure.

       --CCAAppaatthh ddiirreeccttoorryy
           The directory to use for server certificate verification. This
           directory must be in "hash format", see vveerriiffyy for more
           information. These are also used when building the client
           certificate chain.

       --CCAAffiillee ffiillee
           A file containing trusted certificates to use during server
           authentication and to use when attempting to build the client
           certificate chain.

       --nneeww
           performs the timing test using a new session ID for each
           connection.  If neither --nneeww nor --rreeuussee are specified, they are
           both on by default and executed in sequence.

       --rreeuussee
           performs the timing test using the same session ID; this can be
           used as a test that session caching is working. If neither --nneeww nor
           --rreeuussee are specified, they are both on by default and executed in
           sequence.

       --nnbbiioo
           turns on non-blocking I/O.

       --ssssll22, --ssssll33
           these options disable the use of certain SSL or TLS protocols. By
           default the initial handshake uses a method which should be
           compatible with all servers and permit them to use SSL v3, SSL v2
           or TLS as appropriate.  The timing program is not as rich in
           options to turn protocols on and off as the ss__cclliieenntt(1) program and
           may not connect to all servers.

           Unfortunately there are a lot of ancient and broken servers in use
           which cannot handle this technique and will fail to connect. Some
           servers only work if TLS is turned off with the --ssssll33 option;
           others will only support SSL v2 and may need the --ssssll22 option.

       --bbuuggss
           there are several known bug in SSL and TLS implementations. Adding
           this option enables various workarounds.

       --cciipphheerr cciipphheerrlliisstt
           this allows the cipher list sent by the client to be modified.
           Although the server determines which cipher suite is used it should
           take the first supported cipher in the list sent by the client.
           See the cciipphheerrss(1) command for more information.

       --ttiimmee lleennggtthh
           specifies how long (in seconds) ss__ttiimmee should establish connections
           and optionally transfer payload data from a server. Server and
           client performance and the link speed determine how many
           connections ss__ttiimmee can establish.

NNOOTTEESS
       ss__ttiimmee can be used to measure the performance of an SSL connection.  To
       connect to an SSL HTTP server and get the default page the command

        openssl s_time -connect servername:443 -www / -CApath yourdir -CAfile yourfile.pem -cipher commoncipher [-ssl3]

       would typically be used (https uses port 443). 'commoncipher' is a
       cipher to which both client and server can agree, see the cciipphheerrss(1)
       command for details.

       If the handshake fails then there are several possible causes, if it is
       nothing obvious like no client certificate then the --bbuuggss, --ssssll22, --ssssll33
       options can be tried in case it is a buggy server. In particular you
       should play with these options bbeeffoorree submitting a bug report to an
       OpenSSL mailing list.

       A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working
       is that a web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
       list to choose from. This is normally because the server is not sending
       the clients certificate authority in its "acceptable CA list" when it
       requests a certificate. By using ss__cclliieenntt(1) the CA list can be viewed
       and checked. However some servers only request client authentication
       after a specific URL is requested. To obtain the list in this case it
       is necessary to use the --pprreexxiitt option of ss__cclliieenntt(1) and send an HTTP
       request for an appropriate page.

       If a certificate is specified on the command line using the --cceerrtt
       option it will not be used unless the server specifically requests a
       client certificate. Therefor merely including a client certificate on
       the command line is no guarantee that the certificate works.

BBUUGGSS
       Because this program does not have all the options of the ss__cclliieenntt(1)
       program to turn protocols on and off, you may not be able to measure
       the performance of all protocols with all servers.

       The --vveerriiffyy option should really exit if the server verification fails.
