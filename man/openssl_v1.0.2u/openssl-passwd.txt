NAME
       openssl-passwd, passwd - compute password hashes

SYNOPSIS
       openssl passwd [-crypt] [-1] [-apr1] [-salt string] [-in file] [-stdin]
       [-noverify] [-quiet] [-table] {password}

DESCRIPTION
       The passwd command computes the hash of a password typed at run-time or
       the hash of each password in a list.  The password list is taken from
       the named file for option -in file, from stdin for option -stdin, or
       from the command line, or from the terminal otherwise.  The Unix
       standard algorithm crypt and the MD5-based BSD password algorithm 1 and
       its Apache variant apr1 are available.

OPTIONS
       -crypt
           Use the crypt algorithm (default).

       -1  Use the MD5 based BSD password algorithm 1.

       -apr1
           Use the apr1 algorithm (Apache variant of the BSD algorithm).

       -salt string
           Use the specified salt.  When reading a password from the terminal,
           this implies -noverify.

       -in file
           Read passwords from file.

       -stdin
           Read passwords from stdin.

       -noverify
           Don't verify when reading a password from the terminal.

       -quiet
           Don't output warnings when passwords given at the command line are
           truncated.

       -table
           In the output list, prepend the cleartext password and a TAB
           character to each password hash.

EXAMPLES
       openssl passwd -crypt -salt xx password prints xxj31ZMTZzkVA.

       openssl passwd -1 -salt xxxxxxxx password prints
       $1$xxxxxxxx$UYCIxa628.9qXjpQCjM4a..

       openssl passwd -apr1 -salt xxxxxxxx password prints
       $apr1$xxxxxxxx$dxHfLAsjHkDRmG83UXe8K0.
