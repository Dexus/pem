       The CCAA..ppll script is a perl script that supplies the relevant command
       line arguments to the ooppeennssssll command for some common certificate
       operations.  It is intended to simplify the process of certificate
       creation and management by the use of some simple options.

       ??, --hh, --hheellpp
           prints a usage message.

       --nneewwcceerrtt
           creates a new self signed certificate. The private key is written
           to the file "newkey.pem" and the request written to the file
           "newreq.pem".

       --nneewwrreeqq
           creates a new certificate request. The private key is written to
           the file "newkey.pem" and the request written to the file
           "newreq.pem".

       --nneewwrreeqq--nnooddeess
           is like --nneewwrreeqq except that the private key will not be encrypted.

       --nneewwccaa
           creates a new CA hierarchy for use with the ccaa program (or the
           --ssiiggnncceerrtt and --xxssiiggnn options). The user is prompted to enter the
           filename of the CA certificates (which should also contain the
           private key) or by hitting ENTER details of the CA will be prompted
           for. The relevant files and directories are created in a directory
           called "demoCA" in the current directory.

       --ppkkccss1122
           create a PKCS#12 file containing the user certificate, private key
           and CA certificate. It expects the user certificate and private key
           to be in the file "newcert.pem" and the CA certificate to be in the
           file demoCA/cacert.pem, it creates a file "newcert.p12". This
           command can thus be called after the --ssiiggnn option. The PKCS#12 file
           can be imported directly into a browser.  If there is an additional
           argument on the command line it will be used as the "friendly name"
           for the certificate (which is typically displayed in the browser
           list box), otherwise the name "My Certificate" is used.

       --ssiiggnn, --ssiiggnnrreeqq, --xxssiiggnn
           calls the ccaa program to sign a certificate request. It expects the
           request to be in the file "newreq.pem". The new certificate is
           written to the file "newcert.pem" except in the case of the --xxssiiggnn
           option when it is written to standard output.

       --ssiiggnnCCAA
           this option is the same as the --ssiiggnnrreeqq option except it uses the
           configuration file section vv33__ccaa and so makes the signed request a
           valid CA certificate. This is useful when creating intermediate CA
           from a root CA.

       --ssiiggnncceerrtt
           this option is the same as --ssiiggnn except it expects a self signed
           certificate to be present in the file "newreq.pem".

       --vveerriiffyy
           verifies certificates against the CA certificate for "demoCA". If
           no certificates are specified on the command line it tries to
           verify the file "newcert.pem".

       ffiilleess
           one or more optional certificate file names for use with the
           --vveerriiffyy command.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Create a CA hierarchy:

        CA.pl -newca

       Complete certificate creation example: create a CA, create a request,
       sign the request and finally create a PKCS#12 file containing it.

        CA.pl -newca
        CA.pl -newreq
        CA.pl -signreq
        CA.pl -pkcs12 "My Test Certificate"

DDSSAA CCEERRTTIIFFIICCAATTEESS
       Although the CCAA..ppll creates RSA CAs and requests it is still possible to
       use it with DSA certificates and requests using the rreeqq(1) command
       directly. The following example shows the steps that would typically be
       taken.

       Create some DSA parameters:

        openssl dsaparam -out dsap.pem 1024

       Create a DSA CA certificate and private key:

        openssl req -x509 -newkey dsa:dsap.pem -keyout cacert.pem -out cacert.pem

       Create the CA directories and files:

        CA.pl -newca

       enter cacert.pem when prompted for the CA file name.

       Create a DSA certificate request and private key (a different set of
       parameters can optionally be created first):

        openssl req -out newreq.pem -newkey dsa:dsap.pem

       Sign the request:

        CA.pl -signreq

NNOOTTEESS
       Most of the filenames mentioned can be modified by editing the CCAA..ppll
       script.

       If the demoCA directory already exists then the --nneewwccaa command will not
       overwrite it and will do nothing. This can happen if a previous call
       using the --nneewwccaa option terminated abnormally. To get the correct
       behaviour delete the demoCA directory if it already exists.

       Under some environments it may not be possible to run the CCAA..ppll script
       directly (for example Win32) and the default configuration file
       location may be wrong. In this case the command:

        perl -S CA.pl

       can be used and the OOPPEENNSSSSLL__CCOONNFF environment variable changed to point
       to the correct path of the configuration file "openssl.cnf".

       The script is intended as a simple front end for the ooppeennssssll program
       for use by a beginner. Its behaviour isn't always what is wanted. For
       more control over the behaviour of the certificate commands call the
       ooppeennssssll command directly.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       The variable OOPPEENNSSSSLL__CCOONNFF if defined allows an alternative
       configuration file location to be specified, it should contain the full
       path to the configuration file, not just its directory.
