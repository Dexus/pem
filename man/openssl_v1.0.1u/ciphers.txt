NAME
       ciphers - SSL cipher display and cipher list tool.

SYNOPSIS
       openssl ciphers [-v] [-V] [-ssl2] [-ssl3] [-tls1] [cipherlist]

DESCRIPTION
       The ciphers command converts textual OpenSSL cipher lists into ordered
       SSL cipher preference lists. It can be used as a test tool to determine
       the appropriate cipherlist.

COMMAND OPTIONS
       -v  Verbose option. List ciphers with a complete description of
           protocol version (SSLv2 or SSLv3; the latter includes TLS), key
           exchange, authentication, encryption and mac algorithms used along
           with any key size restrictions and whether the algorithm is classed
           as an "export" cipher.  Note that without the -v option, ciphers
           may seem to appear twice in a cipher list; this is when similar
           ciphers are available for SSL v2 and for SSL v3/TLS v1.

       -V  Like -v, but include cipher suite codes in output (hex format).

       -ssl3, -tls1
           This lists ciphers compatible with any of SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 or
           TLSv1.2.

       -ssl2
           Only include SSLv2 ciphers.

       -h, -?
           Print a brief usage message.

       cipherlist
           A cipher list to convert to a cipher preference list. If it is not
           included then the default cipher list will be used. The format is
           described below.

CIPHER LIST FORMAT
       The cipher list consists of one or more cipher strings separated by
       colons.  Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are
       normally used.

       The actual cipher string can take several different forms.

       It can consist of a single cipher suite such as RC4-SHA.

       It can represent a list of cipher suites containing a certain
       algorithm, or cipher suites of a certain type. For example SHA1
       represents all ciphers suites using the digest algorithm SHA1 and SSLv3
       represents all SSL v3 algorithms.

       Lists of cipher suites can be combined in a single cipher string using
       the + character. This is used as a logical and operation. For example
       SHA1+DES represents all cipher suites containing the SHA1 and the DES
       algorithms.

       Each cipher string can be optionally preceded by the characters !, - or
       +.

       If ! is used then the ciphers are permanently deleted from the list.
       The ciphers deleted can never reappear in the list even if they are
       explicitly stated.

       If - is used then the ciphers are deleted from the list, but some or
       all of the ciphers can be added again by later options.

       If + is used then the ciphers are moved to the end of the list. This
       option doesn't add any new ciphers it just moves matching existing
       ones.

       If none of these characters is present then the string is just
       interpreted as a list of ciphers to be appended to the current
       preference list. If the list includes any ciphers already present they
       will be ignored: that is they will not moved to the end of the list.

       Additionally the cipher string @STRENGTH can be used at any point to
       sort the current cipher list in order of encryption algorithm key
       length.

CIPHER STRINGS
       The following is a list of all permitted cipher strings and their
       meanings.

       DEFAULT
           The default cipher list.  This is determined at compile time and is
           normally ALL:!EXPORT:!LOW:!aNULL:!eNULL:!SSLv2.  When used, this
           must be the first cipherstring specified.

       COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT
           the ciphers included in ALL, but not enabled by default. Currently
           this is ADH and AECDH. Note that this rule does not cover eNULL,
           which is not included by ALL (use COMPLEMENTOFALL if necessary).

       ALL all cipher suites except the eNULL ciphers which must be explicitly
           enabled; as of OpenSSL, the ALL cipher suites are reasonably
           ordered by default

       COMPLEMENTOFALL
           the cipher suites not enabled by ALL, currently being eNULL.

       HIGH
           "high" encryption cipher suites. This currently means those with
           key lengths larger than 128 bits, and some cipher suites with
           128-bit keys.

       MEDIUM
           "medium" encryption cipher suites, currently some of those using
           128 bit encryption.

       LOW Low strength encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or
           56 bit encryption algorithms but excluding export cipher suites.
           As of OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are disabled in default builds.

       EXP, EXPORT
           Export strength encryption algorithms. Including 40 and 56 bits
           algorithms.  As of OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are disabled in default
           builds.

       EXPORT40
           40-bit export encryption algorithms As of OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are
           disabled in default builds.

       EXPORT56
           56-bit export encryption algorithms. In OpenSSL 0.9.8c and later
           the set of 56 bit export ciphers is empty unless OpenSSL has been
           explicitly configured with support for experimental ciphers.  As of
           OpenSSL 1.0.1s, these are disabled in default builds.

       eNULL, NULL
           The "NULL" ciphers that is those offering no encryption. Because
           these offer no encryption at all and are a security risk they are
           not enabled via either the DEFAULT or ALL cipher strings.  Be
           careful when building cipherlists out of lower-level primitives
           such as kRSA or aECDSA as these do overlap with the eNULL ciphers.
           When in doubt, include !eNULL in your cipherlist.

       aNULL
           The cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the
           anonymous DH algorithms and anonymous ECDH algorithms. These cipher
           suites are vulnerable to a "man in the middle" attack and so their
           use is normally discouraged.  These are excluded from the DEFAULT
           ciphers, but included in the ALL ciphers.  Be careful when building
           cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as kDHE or AES as
           these do overlap with the aNULL ciphers.  When in doubt, include
           !aNULL in your cipherlist.

           cipher suites using RSA key exchange.

       kDHr, kDHd, kDH

NOTES
       The non-ephemeral DH modes are currently unimplemented in OpenSSL
       because there is no support for DH certificates.

       Some compiled versions of OpenSSL may not include all the ciphers
       listed here because some ciphers were excluded at compile time.

EXAMPLES
       Verbose listing of all OpenSSL ciphers including NULL ciphers:

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL'

       Include all ciphers except NULL and anonymous DH then sort by strength:

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!ADH:@STRENGTH'

       Include all ciphers except ones with no encryption (eNULL) or no
       authentication (aNULL):

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!aNULL'

       Include only 3DES ciphers and then place RSA ciphers last:

        openssl ciphers -v '3DES:+RSA'

       Include all RC4 ciphers but leave out those without authentication:

        openssl ciphers -v 'RC4:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT'

       Include all chiphers with RSA authentication but leave out ciphers
       without encryption.

        openssl ciphers -v 'RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFALL'

HISTORY
       The COMPLENTOFALL and COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT selection options for
       cipherlist strings were added in OpenSSL 0.9.7.  The -V option for the
       ciphers command was added in OpenSSL 1.0.0.
