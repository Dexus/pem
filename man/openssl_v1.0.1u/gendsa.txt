NAME
       gendsa - generate a DSA private key from a set of parameters

SYNOPSIS
       openssl gendsa [-out filename] [-aes128] [-aes192] [-aes256]
       [-camellia128] [-camellia192] [-camellia256] [-des] [-des3] [-idea]
       [-rand file(s)] [-engine id] [paramfile]

DESCRIPTION
       The gendsa command generates a DSA private key from a DSA parameter
       file (which will be typically generated by the openssl dsaparam
       command).

OPTIONS
       -aes128|-aes192|-aes256|-camellia128|-camellia192|-camellia256|-des|-des3|-idea
           These options encrypt the private key with specified cipher before
           outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.  If none of these
           options is specified no encryption is used.

       -rand file(s)
           a file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator, or an EGD socket (see RAND_egd(3)).  Multiple
           files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.  The
           separator is ; for MS-Windows, , for OpenVMS, and : for all others.

       -engine id
           specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause gendsa to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms.

       paramfile
           This option specifies the DSA parameter file to use. The parameters
           in this file determine the size of the private key. DSA parameters
           can be generated and examined using the openssl dsaparam command.

NOTES
       DSA key generation is little more than random number generation so it
       is much quicker that RSA key generation for example.
