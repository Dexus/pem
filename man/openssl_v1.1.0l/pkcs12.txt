DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ppkkccss1122 command allows PKCS#12 files (sometimes referred to as PFX
       files) to be created and parsed. PKCS#12 files are used by several
       programs including Netscape, MSIE and MS Outlook.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       There are a lot of options the meaning of some depends of whether a
       PKCS#12 file is being created or parsed. By default a PKCS#12 file is
       parsed. A PKCS#12 file can be created by using the --eexxppoorrtt option (see
       below).

PPAARRSSIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hheellpp
           Print out a usage message.

       --iinn ffiilleennaammee
           This specifies filename of the PKCS#12 file to be parsed. Standard
           input is used by default.

       --oouutt ffiilleennaammee
           The filename to write certificates and private keys to, standard
           output by default.  They are all written in PEM format.

       --ppaassssiinn aarrgg
           the PKCS#12 file (i.e. input file) password source. For more
           information about the format of aarrgg see the PPAASSSS PPHHRRAASSEE AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
           section in ooppeennssssll(1).

       --ppaassssoouutt aarrgg
           pass phrase source to encrypt any outputted private keys with. For
           more information about the format of aarrgg see the PPAASSSS PPHHRRAASSEE
           AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS section in ooppeennssssll(1).

       --ppaasssswwoorrdd aarrgg
           With -export, -password is equivalent to -passout.  Otherwise,
           -password is equivalent to -passin.

       --nnoooouutt
           this option inhibits output of the keys and certificates to the
           output file version of the PKCS#12 file.

       --ccllcceerrttss
           only output client certificates (not CA certificates).

       --ccaacceerrttss
           only output CA certificates (not client certificates).

       --nnoocceerrttss
           no certificates at all will be output.

       --nnookkeeyyss
           no private keys will be output.

       --iinnffoo
           output additional information about the PKCS#12 file structure,
           algorithms used and iteration counts.

       --ddeess
           use DES to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       --ddeess33
           use triple DES to encrypt private keys before outputting, this is
           the default.

       --iiddeeaa
           use IDEA to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       --aaeess112288, --aaeess119922, --aaeess225566
           use AES to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       --ccaammeelllliiaa112288, --ccaammeelllliiaa119922, --ccaammeelllliiaa225566
           use Camellia to encrypt private keys before outputting.

       --nnooddeess
           don't encrypt the private keys at all.

       --nnoommaaccvveerr
           don't attempt to verify the integrity MAC before reading the file.

       --ttwwooppaassss
           prompt for separate integrity and encryption passwords: most
           software always assumes these are the same so this option will
           render such PKCS#12 files unreadable.

FFIILLEE CCRREEAATTIIOONN OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --eexxppoorrtt
           This option specifies that a PKCS#12 file will be created rather
           than parsed.

       --oouutt ffiilleennaammee
           This specifies filename to write the PKCS#12 file to. Standard
           output is used by default.

       --iinn ffiilleennaammee
           The filename to read certificates and private keys from, standard
           input by default.  They must all be in PEM format. The order
           doesn't matter but one private key and its corresponding
           certificate should be present. If additional certificates are
           present they will also be included in the PKCS#12 file.

       --iinnkkeeyy ffiillee__oorr__iidd
           file to read private key from. If not present then a private key
           must be present in the input file.  If no engine is used, the
           argument is taken as a file; if an engine is specified, the
           argument is given to the engine as a key identifier.

       --nnaammee ffrriieennddllyynnaammee
           This specifies the "friendly name" for the certificate and private
           key. This name is typically displayed in list boxes by software
           importing the file.

       --cceerrttffiillee ffiilleennaammee
           A filename to read additional certificates from.

       --ccaannaammee ffrriieennddllyynnaammee
           This specifies the "friendly name" for other certificates. This
           option may be used multiple times to specify names for all
           certificates in the order they appear. Netscape ignores friendly
           names on other certificates whereas MSIE displays them.

       --ppaassss aarrgg, --ppaassssoouutt aarrgg
           the PKCS#12 file (i.e. output file) password source. For more
           information about the format of aarrgg see the PPAASSSS PPHHRRAASSEE AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
           section in ooppeennssssll(1).

       --ppaassssiinn ppaasssswwoorrdd
           pass phrase source to decrypt any input private keys with. For more
           information about the format of aarrgg see the PPAASSSS PPHHRRAASSEE AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
           section in ooppeennssssll(1).

       --cchhaaiinn
           if this option is present then an attempt is made to include the
           entire certificate chain of the user certificate. The standard CA
           store is used for this search. If the search fails it is considered
           a fatal error.

       --ddeesscceerrtt
           encrypt the certificate using triple DES, this may render the
           PKCS#12 file unreadable by some "export grade" software. By default
           the private key is encrypted using triple DES and the certificate
           using 40 bit RC2.

       --kkeeyyppbbee aallgg, --cceerrttppbbee aallgg
           these options allow the algorithm used to encrypt the private key
           and certificates to be selected. Any PKCS#5 v1.5 or PKCS#12 PBE
           algorithm name can be used (see NNOOTTEESS section for more
           information). If a cipher name (as output by the lliisstt--cciipphheerr--
           aallggoorriitthhmmss command is specified then it is used with PKCS#5 v2.0.
           For interoperability reasons it is advisable to only use PKCS#12
           algorithms.

       --kkeeyyeexx||--kkeeyyssiigg
           specifies that the private key is to be used for key exchange or
           just signing.  This option is only interpreted by MSIE and similar
           MS software. Normally "export grade" software will only allow 512
           bit RSA keys to be used for encryption purposes but arbitrary
           length keys for signing. The --kkeeyyssiigg option marks the key for
           signing only. Signing only keys can be used for S/MIME signing,
           authenticode (ActiveX control signing)  and SSL client
           authentication, however due to a bug only MSIE 5.0 and later
           support the use of signing only keys for SSL client authentication.

       --mmaaccaallgg ddiiggeesstt
           specify the MAC digest algorithm. If not included them SHA1 will be
           used.

       --nnoommaacciitteerr, --nnooiitteerr
           these options affect the iteration counts on the MAC and key
           algorithms.  Unless you wish to produce files compatible with MSIE
           4.0 you should leave these options alone.

           To discourage attacks by using large dictionaries of common
           passwords the algorithm that derives keys from passwords can have
           an iteration count applied to it: this causes a certain part of the
           algorithm to be repeated and slows it down. The MAC is used to
           check the file integrity but since it will normally have the same
           password as the keys and certificates it could also be attacked.
           By default both MAC and encryption iteration counts are set to
           2048, using these options the MAC and encryption iteration counts
           can be set to 1, since this reduces the file security you should
           not use these options unless you really have to. Most software
           supports both MAC and key iteration counts.  MSIE 4.0 doesn't
           support MAC iteration counts so it needs the --nnoommaacciitteerr option.

       --mmaacciitteerr
           This option is included for compatibility with previous versions,
           it used to be needed to use MAC iterations counts but they are now
           used by default.

       --nnoommaacc
           don't attempt to provide the MAC integrity.

       --rraanndd ffiillee((ss))
           a file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator, or an EGD socket (see RRAANNDD__eeggdd(3)).  Multiple
           files can be specified separated by an OS-dependent character.  The
           separator is ;; for MS-Windows, ,, for OpenVMS, and :: for all others.

       --CCAAffiillee ffiillee
           CA storage as a file.

       --CCAAppaatthh ddiirr
           CA storage as a directory. This directory must be a standard
           certificate directory: that is a hash of each subject name (using
           xx550099 --hhaasshh) should be linked to each certificate.

       --nnoo--CCAAffiillee
           Do not load the trusted CA certificates from the default file
           location

       --nnoo--CCAAppaatthh
           Do not load the trusted CA certificates from the default directory
           location

       --CCSSPP nnaammee
           write nnaammee as a Microsoft CSP name.

NNOOTTEESS
       Although there are a large number of options most of them are very
       rarely used. For PKCS#12 file parsing only --iinn and --oouutt need to be used
       for PKCS#12 file creation --eexxppoorrtt and --nnaammee are also used.

       If none of the --ccllcceerrttss, --ccaacceerrttss or --nnoocceerrttss options are present then
       all certificates will be output in the order they appear in the input
       PKCS#12 files. There is no guarantee that the first certificate present
       is the one corresponding to the private key. Certain software which
       requires a private key and certificate and assumes the first
       certificate in the file is the one corresponding to the private key:
       this may not always be the case. Using the --ccllcceerrttss option will solve
       this problem by only outputting the certificate corresponding to the
       private key. If the CA certificates are required then they can be
       output to a separate file using the --nnookkeeyyss --ccaacceerrttss options to just
       output CA certificates.

       The --kkeeyyppbbee and --cceerrttppbbee algorithms allow the precise encryption
       algorithms for private keys and certificates to be specified. Normally
       the defaults are fine but occasionally software can't handle triple DES
       encrypted private keys, then the option --kkeeyyppbbee PPBBEE--SSHHAA11--RRCC22--4400 can be
       used to reduce the private key encryption to 40 bit RC2. A complete
       description of all algorithms is contained in the ppkkccss88 manual page.

       Prior 1.1 release passwords containing non-ASCII characters were
       encoded in non-compliant manner, which limited interoperability, in
       first hand with Windows. But switching to standard-compliant password
       encoding poses problem accessing old data protected with broken
       encoding. For this reason even legacy encodings is attempted when
       reading the data. If you use PKCS#12 files in production application
       you are advised to convert the data, because implemented heuristic
       approach is not MT-safe, its sole goal is to facilitate the data
       upgrade with this utility.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       Parse a PKCS#12 file and output it to a file:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -out file.pem

       Output only client certificates to a file:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -clcerts -out file.pem

       Don't encrypt the private key:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -out file.pem -nodes

       Print some info about a PKCS#12 file:

        openssl pkcs12 -in file.p12 -info -noout

       Create a PKCS#12 file:

        openssl pkcs12 -export -in file.pem -out file.p12 -name "My Certificate"

       Include some extra certificates:

        openssl pkcs12 -export -in file.pem -out file.p12 -name "My Certificate" \
         -certfile othercerts.pem
