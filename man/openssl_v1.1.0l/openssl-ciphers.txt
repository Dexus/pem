NAME
       openssl-ciphers, ciphers - SSL cipher display and cipher list tool

SYNOPSIS
       openssl ciphers [-help] [-s] [-v] [-V] [-ssl3] [-tls1] [-tls1_1]
       [-tls1_2] [-s] [-psk] [-srp] [-stdname] [cipherlist]

DESCRIPTION
       The ciphers command converts textual OpenSSL cipher lists into ordered
       SSL cipher preference lists. It can be used as a test tool to determine
       the appropriate cipherlist.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print a usage message.

       -s  Only list supported ciphers: those consistent with the security
           level, and minimum and maximum protocol version.  This is closer to
           the actual cipher list an application will support.

           PSK and SRP ciphers are not enabled by default: they require -psk
           or -srp to enable them.

           It also does not change the default list of supported signature
           algorithms.

           On a server the list of supported ciphers might also exclude other
           ciphers depending on the configured certificates and presence of DH
           parameters.

           If this option is not used then all ciphers that match the
           cipherlist will be listed.

       -psk
           When combined with -s includes cipher suites which require PSK.

       -srp
           When combined with -s includes cipher suites which require SRP.

       -v  Verbose output: For each ciphersuite, list details as provided by
           SSL_CIPHER_description(3).

       -V  Like -v, but include the official cipher suite values in hex.

       -tls1_2
           In combination with the -s option, list the ciphers which would be
           used if TLSv1.2 were negotiated.

       -ssl3
           In combination with the -s option, list the ciphers which would be
           used if SSLv3 were negotiated.

       -tls1
           In combination with the -s option, list the ciphers which would be
           used if TLSv1 were negotiated.

       -tls1_1
           In combination with the -s option, list the ciphers which would be
           used if TLSv1.1 were negotiated.

       -stdname
           precede each ciphersuite by its standard name: only available is
           OpenSSL is built with tracing enabled (enable-ssl-trace argument to
           Configure).

       cipherlist
           a cipher list to convert to a cipher preference list. If it is not
           included then the default cipher list will be used. The format is
           described below.

CIPHER LIST FORMAT
       The cipher list consists of one or more cipher strings separated by
       colons.  Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are
       normally used.

       The actual cipher string can take several different forms.

       It can consist of a single cipher suite such as RC4-SHA.

       It can represent a list of cipher suites containing a certain
       algorithm, or cipher suites of a certain type. For example SHA1
       represents all ciphers suites using the digest algorithm SHA1 and SSLv3
       represents all SSL v3 algorithms.

       Lists of cipher suites can be combined in a single cipher string using
       the + character. This is used as a logical and operation. For example
       SHA1+DES represents all cipher suites containing the SHA1 and the DES
       algorithms.

       Each cipher string can be optionally preceded by the characters !, - or
       +.

       If ! is used then the ciphers are permanently deleted from the list.
       The ciphers deleted can never reappear in the list even if they are
       explicitly stated.

       If - is used then the ciphers are deleted from the list, but some or
       all of the ciphers can be added again by later options.

       If + is used then the ciphers are moved to the end of the list. This
       option doesn't add any new ciphers it just moves matching existing
       ones.

       If none of these characters is present then the string is just
       interpreted as a list of ciphers to be appended to the current
       preference list. If the list includes any ciphers already present they
       will be ignored: that is they will not moved to the end of the list.

       The cipher string @STRENGTH can be used at any point to sort the
       current cipher list in order of encryption algorithm key length.

       The cipher string @SECLEVEL=n can be used at any point to set the
       security level to n.

CIPHER STRINGS
       The following is a list of all permitted cipher strings and their
       meanings.

       DEFAULT
           The default cipher list.  This is determined at compile time and is
           normally ALL:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT:!eNULL.  When used, this must be
           the first cipherstring specified.

       COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT
           The ciphers included in ALL, but not enabled by default. Currently
           this includes all RC4 and anonymous ciphers. Note that this rule
           does not cover eNULL, which is not included by ALL (use
           COMPLEMENTOFALL if necessary). Note that RC4 based ciphersuites are
           not built into OpenSSL by default (see the enable-weak-ssl-ciphers
           option to Configure).

       ALL All cipher suites except the eNULL ciphers (which must be
           explicitly enabled if needed).  As of OpenSSL 1.0.0, the ALL cipher
           suites are sensibly ordered by default.

       COMPLEMENTOFALL
           The cipher suites not enabled by ALL, currently eNULL.

       HIGH
           "high" encryption cipher suites. This currently means those with
           key lengths larger than 128 bits, and some cipher suites with
           128-bit keys.

       MEDIUM
           "medium" encryption cipher suites, currently some of those using
           128 bit encryption.

       LOW "low" encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or 56 bit
           encryption algorithms but excluding export cipher suites.  All
           these ciphersuites have been removed as of OpenSSL 1.1.0.

       eNULL, NULL
           The "NULL" ciphers that is those offering no encryption. Because
           these offer no encryption at all and are a security risk they are
           not enabled via either the DEFAULT or ALL cipher strings.  Be
           careful when building cipherlists out of lower-level primitives
           such as kRSA or aECDSA as these do overlap with the eNULL ciphers.
           When in doubt, include !eNULL in your cipherlist.

       aNULL
           The cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the
           anonymous DH algorithms and anonymous ECDH algorithms. These cipher
           suites are vulnerable to "man in the middle" attacks and so their
           use is discouraged.  These are excluded from the DEFAULT ciphers,
           but included in the ALL ciphers.  Be careful when building
           cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as kDHE or AES as
           these do overlap with the aNULL ciphers.  When in doubt, include
           !aNULL in your cipherlist.

       kRSA, aRSA, RSA
           Cipher suites using RSA key exchange or authentication. RSA is an
           alias for kRSA.

       kDHr, kDHd, kDH
           Cipher suites using static DH key agreement and DH certificates
           signed by CAs with RSA and DSS keys or either respectively.  All
           these cipher suites have been removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

       kDHE, kEDH, DH
           Cipher suites using ephemeral DH key agreement, including anonymous
           cipher suites.

       DHE, EDH
           Cipher suites using authenticated ephemeral DH key agreement.

       ADH Anonymous DH cipher suites, note that this does not include
           anonymous Elliptic Curve DH (ECDH) cipher suites.

       kEECDH, kECDHE, ECDH
           Cipher suites using ephemeral ECDH key agreement, including
           anonymous cipher suites.

       ECDHE, EECDH
           Cipher suites using authenticated ephemeral ECDH key agreement.

       AECDH
           Anonymous Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.

       aDSS, DSS
           Cipher suites using DSS authentication, i.e. the certificates carry
           DSS keys.

       aDH Cipher suites effectively using DH authentication, i.e. the
           certificates carry DH keys.  All these cipher suites have been
           removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

       aECDSA, ECDSA
           Cipher suites using ECDSA authentication, i.e. the certificates
           carry ECDSA keys.

       TLSv1.2, TLSv1.0, SSLv3
           Lists ciphersuites which are only supported in at least TLS v1.2,
           TLS v1.0 or SSL v3.0 respectively.  Note: there are no ciphersuites
           specific to TLS v1.1.  Since this is only the minimum version, if,
           for example, TLSv1.0 is negotiated then both TLSv1.0 and SSLv3.0
           ciphersuites are available.

           Note: these cipher strings do not change the negotiated version of
           SSL or TLS, they only affect the list of available cipher suites.

       AES128, AES256, AES
           cipher suites using 128 bit AES, 256 bit AES or either 128 or 256
           bit AES.

       AESGCM
           AES in Galois Counter Mode (GCM): these ciphersuites are only
           supported in TLS v1.2.

       AESCCM, AESCCM8
           AES in Cipher Block Chaining - Message Authentication Mode (CCM):
           these ciphersuites are only supported in TLS v1.2. AESCCM
           references CCM cipher suites using both 16 and 8 octet Integrity
           Check Value (ICV) while AESCCM8 only references 8 octet ICV.

       CAMELLIA128, CAMELLIA256, CAMELLIA
           cipher suites using 128 bit CAMELLIA, 256 bit CAMELLIA or either
           128 or 256 bit CAMELLIA.

       CHACHA20
           cipher suites using ChaCha20.

       3DES
           cipher suites using triple DES.

       DES Cipher suites using DES (not triple DES).  All these cipher suites
           have been removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

       RC4 Cipher suites using RC4.

       RC2 Cipher suites using RC2.

       IDEA
           Cipher suites using IDEA.

       SEED
           Cipher suites using SEED.

       MD5 Cipher suites using MD5.

       SHA1, SHA
           Cipher suites using SHA1.

       SHA256, SHA384
           Ciphersuites using SHA256 or SHA384.

       aGOST
           Cipher suites using GOST R 34.10 (either 2001 or 94) for
           authentication (needs an engine supporting GOST algorithms).

       aGOST01
           Cipher suites using GOST R 34.10-2001 authentication.

       kGOST
           Cipher suites, using VKO 34.10 key exchange, specified in the RFC
           4357.

       GOST94
           Cipher suites, using HMAC based on GOST R 34.11-94.

       GOST89MAC
           Cipher suites using GOST 28147-89 MAC instead of HMAC.

       PSK All cipher suites using pre-shared keys (PSK).

       kPSK, kECDHEPSK, kDHEPSK, kRSAPSK
           Cipher suites using PSK key exchange, ECDHE_PSK, DHE_PSK or
           RSA_PSK.

       aPSK
           Cipher suites using PSK authentication (currently all PSK modes
           apart from RSA_PSK).

       SUITEB128, SUITEB128ONLY, SUITEB192
           Enables suite B mode of operation using 128 (permitting 192 bit
           mode by peer) 128 bit (not permitting 192 bit by peer) or 192 bit
           level of security respectively.  If used these cipherstrings should
           appear first in the cipher list and anything after them is ignored.
           Setting Suite B mode has additional consequences required to comply
           with RFC6460.  In particular the supported signature algorithms is
           reduced to support only ECDSA and SHA256 or SHA384, only the
           elliptic curves P-256 and P-384 can be used and only the two suite
           B compliant ciphersuites (ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 and
           ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384) are permissible.

CIPHER SUITE NAMES
       The following lists give the SSL or TLS cipher suites names from the
       relevant specification and their OpenSSL equivalents. It should be
       noted, that several cipher suite names do not include the
       authentication used, e.g. DES-CBC3-SHA. In these cases, RSA
       authentication is used.

   Older names used by OpenSSL
       The following names are accepted by older releases:

        SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA    EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA (DHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA)
        SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA    EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA (DHE-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA)

NOTES
       Some compiled versions of OpenSSL may not include all the ciphers
       listed here because some ciphers were excluded at compile time.

EXAMPLES
       Verbose listing of all OpenSSL ciphers including NULL ciphers:

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL'

       Include all ciphers except NULL and anonymous DH then sort by strength:

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!ADH:@STRENGTH'

       Include all ciphers except ones with no encryption (eNULL) or no
       authentication (aNULL):

        openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!aNULL'

       Include only 3DES ciphers and then place RSA ciphers last:

        openssl ciphers -v '3DES:+RSA'

       Include all RC4 ciphers but leave out those without authentication:

        openssl ciphers -v 'RC4:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT'

       Include all ciphers with RSA authentication but leave out ciphers
       without encryption.

        openssl ciphers -v 'RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFALL'

       Set security level to 2 and display all ciphers consistent with level
       2:

        openssl ciphers -s -v 'ALL:@SECLEVEL=2'
