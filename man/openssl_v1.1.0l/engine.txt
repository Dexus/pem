ENGINE(1)                           OpenSSL                          ENGINE(1)



NAME
       openssl-engine, engine - load and query engines

SYNOPSIS
       openssl engine [ engine... ] [-v] [-vv] [-vvv] [-vvv] [-vvv] [-c] [-t]
       [-tt] [-pre command] [-post command] [ engine... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The engine command is used to query the status and capabilities of the
       specified engine's.  Engines may be specified before and after all
       other command-line flags.  Only those specified are queried.

OPTIONS
       -v -vv -vvv -vvvv
           Provides information about each specified engine. The first flag
           lists all the possible run-time control commands; the second adds a
           description of each command; the third adds the input flags, and
           the final option adds the internal input flags.

       -c  Lists the capabilities of each engine.

       -t  Tests if each specified engine is available, and displays the
           answer.

       -tt Displays an error trace for any unavailable engine.

       -pre command
       -post command
           Command-line configuration of engines.  The -pre command is given
           to the engine before it is loaded and the -post command is given
           after the engine is loaded.  The command is of the form cmd:val
           where cmd is the command, and val is the value for the command.
           See the example below.

EXAMPLE
       To list all the commands available to a dynamic engine:

        % openssl engine -t -tt -vvvv dynamic
        (dynamic) Dynamic engine loading support
             [ unavailable ]
             SO_PATH: Specifies the path to the new ENGINE shared library
                  (input flags): STRING
             NO_VCHECK: Specifies to continue even if version checking fails (boolean)
                  (input flags): NUMERIC
             ID: Specifies an ENGINE id name for loading
                  (input flags): STRING
             LIST_ADD: Whether to add a loaded ENGINE to the internal list (0=no,1=yes,2=mandatory)
                  (input flags): NUMERIC
             DIR_LOAD: Specifies whether to load from 'DIR_ADD' directories (0=no,1=yes,2=mandatory)
                  (input flags): NUMERIC
             DIR_ADD: Adds a directory from which ENGINEs can be loaded
                  (input flags): STRING
             LOAD: Load up the ENGINE specified by other settings
                  (input flags): NO_INPUT

       To list the capabilities of the rsax engine:

        % openssl engine -c
        (rsax) RSAX engine support
         [RSA]
        (dynamic) Dynamic engine loading support

ENVIRONMENT
       OPENSSL_ENGINES
           The path to the engines directory.
