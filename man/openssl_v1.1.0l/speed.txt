NAME
       openssl-speed, speed - test library performance

SYNOPSIS
       openssl speed [-help] [-engine id] [-elapsed] [-evp algo] [-decrypt]
       [algorithm...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to test the performance of cryptographic
       algorithms.  To see the list of supported algorithms, use the list
       --digest-commands or list --cipher-commands command.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -engine id
           specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause speed to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms.

       -elapsed
           Measure time in real time instead of CPU time. It can be useful
           when testing speed of hardware engines.

       -evp algo
           Use the specified cipher or message digest algorithm via the EVP
           interface.

       -decrypt
           Time the decryption instead of encryption. Affects only the EVP
           testing.

       [zero or more test algorithms]
           If any options are given, speed tests those algorithms, otherwise
           all of the above are tested.
