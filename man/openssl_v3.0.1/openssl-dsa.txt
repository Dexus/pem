       openssl-dsa - DSA key processing

DESCRIPTION
       This command processes DSA keys. They can be converted between various
       forms and their components printed out. Note This command uses the
       traditional SSLeay compatible format for private key encryption: newer
       applications should use the more secure PKCS#8 format using the pkcs8

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM
           The key input format; unspecified by default.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -outform DER|PEM
           The key output format; the default is PEM.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

           Private keys are a sequence of ASN.1 INTEGERS: the version (zero),
           p, q, g, and the public and private key components.  Public keys
           are a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure with the DSA type.

           The PEM format also accepts PKCS#8 data.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard
           input if this option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a
           pass phrase will be prompted for.

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard
           output by is not specified. If any encryption options are set then
           a pass phrase will be prompted for. The output filename should not
           be the same as the input filename.

       -passin arg, -passout arg
           The password source for the input and output file.  For more
           information about the format of arg see
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -aes128, -aes192, -aes256, -aria128, -aria192, -aria256, -camellia128,
       -camellia192, -camellia256, -des, -des3, -idea
           These options encrypt the private key with the specified cipher
           before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.  If none of
           these options is specified the key is written in plain text. This
           means that this command can be used to remove the pass phrase from
           a key by not giving any encryption option is given, or to add or
           change the pass phrase by setting them.  These options can only be
           used with PEM format output files.

       -text
           Prints out the public, private key components and parameters.

       -noout
           This option prevents output of the encoded version of the key.

       -modulus
           This option prints out the value of the public key component of the
           key.

       -pubin
           By default, a private key is read from the input file. With this
           option a public key is read instead.

       -pubout
           By default, a private key is output. With this option a public key
           will be output instead. This option is automatically set if the
           input is a public key.

       -pvk-strong
           Enable 'Strong' PVK encoding level (default).

       -pvk-weak
           Enable 'Weak' PVK encoding level.

       -pvk-none
           Don't enforce PVK encoding.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

       The openssl-pkey(1) command is capable of performing all the operations
       this command can, as well as supporting other public key types.

EXAMPLES
       The documentation for the openssl-pkey(1) command contains examples
       equivalent to the ones listed here.

       To remove the pass phrase on a DSA private key:

        openssl dsa -in key.pem -out keyout.pem

       To encrypt a private key using triple DES:

        openssl dsa -in key.pem -des3 -out keyout.pem

       To convert a private key from PEM to DER format:

        openssl dsa -in key.pem -outform DER -out keyout.der

       To print out the components of a private key to standard output:

        openssl dsa -in key.pem -text -noout

       To just output the public part of a private key:

        openssl dsa -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem

HISTORY
       The -engine option was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
