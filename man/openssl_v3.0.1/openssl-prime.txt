NAME
       openssl-prime - compute prime numbers

SYNOPSIS
       openssl prime [-help] [-hex] [-generate] [-bits num] [-safe] [-provider
       name] [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq] [-checks num] [number
       ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command checks if the specified numbers are prime.

       If no numbers are given on the command line, the -generate flag should
       be used to generate primes according to the requirements specified by
       the rest of the flags.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Display an option summary.

       -hex
           Generate hex output.

       -generate
           Generate a prime number.

       -bits num
           Generate a prime with num bits.

       -safe
           When used with -generate, generates a "safe" prime. If the number
           generated is n, then check that "(n-1)/2" is also prime.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

       -checks num
           This parameter is ignored.
