DESCRIPTION
       This command has been deprecated.  The openssl-genpkey(1) command
       should be used instead.

       This command generates an RSA private key.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out filename
           Output the key to the specified file. If this argument is not
           specified then standard output is used.

       -passout arg
           The output file password source. For more information about the
           format see openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -aes128, -aes192, -aes256, -aria128, -aria192, -aria256, -camellia128,
       -camellia192, -camellia256, -des, -des3, -idea
           These options encrypt the private key with specified cipher before
           outputting it. If none of these options is specified no encryption
           is used. If encryption is used a pass phrase is prompted for if it
           is not supplied via the -passout argument.

       -F4, -f4, -3
           The public exponent to use, either 65537 or 3. The default is
           65537.  The -3 option has been deprecated.

       -primes num
           Specify the number of primes to use while generating the RSA key.
           The num parameter must be a positive integer that is greater than 1
           and less than 16.  If num is greater than 2, then the generated key
           is called a 'multi-prime' RSA key, which is defined in RFC 8017.

       -verbose
           Print extra details about the operations being performed.

       -traditional
           Write the key using the traditional PKCS#1 format instead of the
           PKCS#8 format.

       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

       numbits
           The size of the private key to generate in bits. This must be the
           last option specified. The default is 2048 and values less than 512
           are not allowed.

NOTES
       RSA private key generation essentially involves the generation of two
       or more prime numbers. When generating a private key various symbols
       will be output to indicate the progress of the generation. A .
       represents each number which has passed an initial sieve test, + means
       a number has passed a single round of the Miller-Rabin primality test,
       * means the current prime starts a regenerating progress due to some
       failed tests. A newline means that the number has passed all the prime
       tests (the actual number depends on the key size).

       Because key generation is a random process the time taken to generate a
       key may vary somewhat. But in general, more primes lead to less
       generation time of a key.
