NAME
       openssl-namedisplay-options - Distinguished name display options

SYNOPSIS
       openssl command [ options ... ] [ parameters ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       OpenSSL provides fine-grain control over how the subject and issuer
       DN's are displayed.  This is specified by using the -nameopt option,
       which takes a comma-separated list of options from the following set.
       An option may be preceded by a minus sign, "-", to turn it off.  The
       default value is "oneline".  The first four are the most commonly used.

OPTIONS
   Name Format Option Arguments
       The DN output format can be fine tuned with the following flags.

       compat
           Display the name using an old format from previous OpenSSL
           versions.

       RFC2253
           Display the name using the format defined in RFC 2253.  It is
           equivalent to esc_2253, esc_ctrl, esc_msb, utf8, dump_nostr,
           dump_unknown, dump_der, sep_comma_plus, dn_rev and sname.

       oneline
           Display the name in one line, using a format that is more readable
           RFC 2253.  It is equivalent to esc_2253, esc_ctrl, esc_msb, utf8,
           dump_nostr, dump_der, use_quote, sep_comma_plus_space, space_eq and
           sname options.

       multiline
           Display the name using multiple lines.  It is equivalent to
           esc_ctrl, esc_msb, sep_multiline, space_eq, lname and align.

       esc_2253
           Escape the "special" characters in a field, as required by RFC
           2253.  That is, any of the characters ",+"<>;", "#" at the
           beginning of a string and leading or trailing spaces.

       esc_2254
           Escape the "special" characters in a field as required by RFC 2254
           in a field.  That is, the NUL character and of "()*".

       esc_ctrl
           Escape non-printable ASCII characters, codes less than 0x20 (space)
           or greater than 0x7F (DELETE). They are displayed using RFC 2253
           "\XX" notation where XX are the two hex digits representing the
           character value.

       esc_msb
           Escape any characters with the most significant bit set, that is
           with values larger than 127, as described in esc_ctrl.

       use_quote
           Escapes some characters by surrounding the entire string with
           quotation marks, """.  Without this option, individual special
           characters are preceded with a backslash character, "\".

       utf8
           Convert all strings to UTF-8 format first as required by RFC 2253.
           If the output device is UTF-8 compatible, then using this option
           (and not setting esc_msb) may give the correct display of multibyte
           characters.  If this option is not set, then multibyte characters
           larger than 0xFF will be output as "\UXXXX" for 16 bits or
           "\WXXXXXXXX" for 32 bits.  In addition, any UTF8Strings will be
           converted to their character form first.

       ignore_type
           This option does not attempt to interpret multibyte characters in
           any way. That is, the content octets are merely dumped as though
           one octet represents each character. This is useful for diagnostic
           purposes but will result in rather odd looking output.

       show_type
           Display the type of the ASN1 character string before the value,
           such as "BMPSTRING: Hello World".

       dump_der
           Any fields that would be output in hex format are displayed using
           the DER encoding of the field.  If not set, just the content octets
           are displayed.  Either way, the #XXXX... format of RFC 2253 is
           used.

       dump_nostr
           Dump non-character strings, such as ASN.1 OCTET STRING.  If this
           option is not set, then non character string types will be
           displayed as though each content octet represents a single
           character.

       dump_all
           Dump all fields. When this used with dump_der, this allows the DER
           encoding of the structure to be unambiguously determined.

       dump_unknown
           Dump any field whose OID is not recognised by OpenSSL.

       sep_comma_plus, sep_comma_plus_space, sep_semi_plus_space,
       sep_multiline
           Specify the field separators. The first word is used between the
           Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs) and the second is between
           multiple Attribute Value Assertions (AVAs). Multiple AVAs are very
           rare and their use is discouraged.  The options ending in "space"
           additionally place a space after the separator to make it more
           readable.  The sep_multiline starts each field on its own line, and
           uses "plus space" for the AVA separator.  It also indents the
           fields by four characters.  The default value is
           sep_comma_plus_space.

       dn_rev
           Reverse the fields of the DN as required by RFC 2253.  This also
           reverses the order of multiple AVAs in a field, but this is
           permissible as there is no ordering on values.

       nofname, sname, lname, oid
           Specify how the field name is displayed.  nofname does not display
           the field at all.  sname uses the "short name" form (CN for
           commonName for example).  lname uses the long form.  oid represents
           the OID in numerical form and is useful for diagnostic purpose.

       align
           Align field values for a more readable output. Only usable with
           sep_multiline.

       space_eq
           Places spaces round the equal sign, "=", character which follows
           the field name.
