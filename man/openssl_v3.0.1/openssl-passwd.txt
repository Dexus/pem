NAME
       openssl-passwd - compute password hashes

SYNOPSIS
       openssl passwd [-help] [-1] [-apr1] [-aixmd5] [-5] [-6] [-salt string]
       [-in file] [-stdin] [-noverify] [-quiet] [-table] [-reverse] [-rand
       files] [-writerand file] [-provider name] [-provider-path path]
       [-propquery propq] [password]

DESCRIPTION
       This command computes the hash of a password typed at run-time or the
       hash of each password in a list.  The password list is taken from the
       named file for option -in, from stdin for option -stdin, or from the
       command line, or from the terminal otherwise.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -1  Use the MD5 based BSD password algorithm 1 (default).

       -apr1
           Use the apr1 algorithm (Apache variant of the BSD algorithm).

       -aixmd5
           Use the AIX MD5 algorithm (AIX variant of the BSD algorithm).

       -5
       -6  Use the SHA256 / SHA512 based algorithms defined by Ulrich Drepper.
           See <https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/SHA-crypt.txt>.

       -salt string
           Use the specified salt.  When reading a password from the terminal,
           this implies -noverify.

       -in file
           Read passwords from file.

       -stdin
           Read passwords from stdin.

       -noverify
           Don't verify when reading a password from the terminal.

       -quiet
           Don't output warnings when passwords given at the command line are
           truncated.

       -table
           In the output list, prepend the cleartext password and a TAB
           character to each password hash.

       -reverse
           When the -table option is used, reverse the order of cleartext and
           hash.

       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

EXAMPLES
         % openssl passwd -1 -salt xxxxxxxx password
         $1$xxxxxxxx$UYCIxa628.9qXjpQCjM4a.

         % openssl passwd -apr1 -salt xxxxxxxx password
         $apr1$xxxxxxxx$dxHfLAsjHkDRmG83UXe8K0

         % openssl passwd -aixmd5 -salt xxxxxxxx password
         xxxxxxxx$8Oaipk/GPKhC64w/YVeFD/

HISTORY
       The -crypt option was removed in OpenSSL 3.0.
