DESCRIPTION
       This command output the message digest of a supplied file or files in
       hexadecimal, and also generates and verifies digital signatures using
       message digests.

       The generic name, openssl dgst, may be used with an option specifying
       the algorithm to be used.  The default digest is sha256.  A supported
       digest name may also be used as the sub-command name.  To see the list
       of supported algorithms, use "openssl list -digest-commands"

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -digest
           Specifies name of a supported digest to be used. To see the list of
           supported digests, use the command "list --digest-commands".

       -c  Print out the digest in two digit groups separated by colons, only
           relevant if the -hex option is given as well.

       -d, -debug
           Print out BIO debugging information.

       -list
           Prints out a list of supported message digests.

       -hex
           Digest is to be output as a hex dump. This is the default case for
           a "normal" digest as opposed to a digital signature.  See NOTES
           below for digital signatures using -hex.

       -binary
           Output the digest or signature in binary form.

       -xoflen length
           Set the output length for XOF algorithms, such as shake128.

       -r  Output the digest in the "coreutils" format, including newlines.
           Used by programs like sha1sum(1).

       -out filename
           Filename to output to, or standard output by default.

       -sign filename|uri
           Digitally sign the digest using the given private key. Note this
           option does not support Ed25519 or Ed448 private keys. Use the
           openssl-pkeyutl(1) command instead for this.

       -keyform DER|PEM|P12|ENGINE
           The format of the key to sign with; unspecified by default.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -sigopt nm:v
           Pass options to the signature algorithm during sign or verify
           operations.  Names and values of these options are algorithm-
           specific.

       -passin arg
           The private key password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -verify filename
           Verify the signature using the public key in "filename".  The
           output is either "Verified OK" or "Verification Failure".

       -prverify filename
           Verify the signature using the private key in "filename".

       -signature filename
           The actual signature to verify.

       -hmac key
           Create a hashed MAC using "key".

           The openssl-mac(1) command should be preferred to using this
           command line option.

       -mac alg
           Create MAC (keyed Message Authentication Code). The most popular
           MAC algorithm is HMAC (hash-based MAC), but there are other MAC
           algorithms which are not based on hash, for instance gost-mac
           algorithm, supported by the gost engine. MAC keys and other options
           should be set via -macopt parameter.

           The openssl-mac(1) command should be preferred to using this
           command line option.

       -macopt nm:v
           Passes options to MAC algorithm, specified by -mac key.  Following
           options are supported by both by HMAC and gost-mac:

           key:string
               Specifies MAC key as alphanumeric string (use if key contain
               printable characters only). String length must conform to any
               restrictions of the MAC algorithm for example exactly 32 chars
               for gost-mac.

           hexkey:string
               Specifies MAC key in hexadecimal form (two hex digits per
               byte).  Key length must conform to any restrictions of the MAC
               algorithm for example exactly 32 chars for gost-mac.

           The openssl-mac(1) command should be preferred to using this
           command line option.

       -fips-fingerprint
           Compute HMAC using a specific key for certain OpenSSL-FIPS
           operations.

       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

           The engine is not used for digests unless the -engine_impl option
           is used or it is configured to do so, see "Engine Configuration
           Module" in config(5).

       -engine_impl id
           When used with the -engine option, it specifies to also use engine
           id for digest operations.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

       file ...
           File or files to digest. If no files are specified then standard
           input is used.

EXAMPLES
       To create a hex-encoded message digest of a file:
        openssl dgst -md5 -hex file.txt

       To sign a file using SHA-256 with binary file output:
        openssl dgst -sha256 -sign privatekey.pem -out signature.sign file.txt

       To verify a signature:
        openssl dgst -sha256 -verify publickey.pem \
        -signature signature.sign \
        file.txt

NOTES
       The digest mechanisms that are available will depend on the options
       used when building OpenSSL.  The "openssl list -digest-commands"
       command can be used to list them.

       New or agile applications should use probably use SHA-256. Other
       digests, particularly SHA-1 and MD5, are still widely used for
       interoperating with existing formats and protocols.

       When signing a file, this command will automatically determine the
       algorithm (RSA, ECC, etc) to use for signing based on the private key's
       ASN.1 info.  When verifying signatures, it only handles the RSA, DSA,
       or ECDSA signature itself, not the related data to identify the signer
       and algorithm used in formats such as x.509, CMS, and S/MIME.

       A source of random numbers is required for certain signing algorithms,
       in particular ECDSA and DSA.

       The signing and verify options should only be used if a single file is
       being signed or verified.

       Hex signatures cannot be verified using openssl.  Instead, use "xxd -r"
       or similar program to transform the hex signature into a binary
       signature prior to verification.

       The openssl-mac(1) command is preferred over the -hmac, -mac and
       -macopt command line options.

       The -engine and -engine_impl options were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
