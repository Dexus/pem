DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to generate a FIPS module configuration file.
       This configuration file can be used each time a FIPS module is loaded
       in order to pass data to the FIPS module self tests. The FIPS module
       always verifies its MAC, but optionally only needs to run the KAT's
       once, at installation.

       The generated configuration file consists of:

       - A MAC of the FIPS module file.
       - A test status indicator.
           This indicates if the Known Answer Self Tests (KAT's) have
           successfully run.

       - A MAC of the status indicator.
       - A control for conditional self tests errors.
           By default if a continuous test (e.g a key pair test) fails then
           the FIPS module will enter an error state, and no services or
           cryptographic algorithms will be able to be accessed after this
           point.  The default value of '1' will cause the fips module error
           state to be entered.  If the value is '0' then the module error
           state will not be entered.  Regardless of whether the error state
           is entered or not, the current operation (e.g. key generation) will
           return an error. The user is responsible for retrying the operation
           if the module error state is not entered.

       - A control to indicate whether run-time security checks are done.
           This indicates if run-time checks related to enforcement of
           security parameters such as minimum security strength of keys and
           approved curve names are used.  The default value of '1' will
           perform the checks.  If the value is '0' the checks are not
           performed and FIPS compliance must be done by procedures documented
           in the relevant Security Policy.

       This file is described in fips_config(5).

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print a usage message.

       -module filename
           Filename of the FIPS module to perform an integrity check on.  The
           path provided in the filename is used to load the module when it is
           activated, and this overrides the environment variable
           OPENSSL_MODULES.

       -out configfilename
           Filename to output the configuration data to; the default is
           standard output.

       -in configfilename
           Input filename to load configuration data from.  Must be used if
           the -verify option is specified.

       -verify
           Verify that the input configuration file contains the correct
           information.

       -provider_name providername
           Name of the provider inside the configuration file.  The default
           value is "fips".

       -section_name sectionname
           Name of the section inside the configuration file.  The default
           value is "fips_sect".

       -mac_name name
           Specifies the name of a supported MAC algorithm which will be used.
           The MAC mechanisms that are available will depend on the options
           used when building OpenSSL.  To see the list of supported MAC's use
           the command "openssl list -mac-algorithms".  The default is HMAC.

       -macopt nm:v
           Passes options to the MAC algorithm.  A comprehensive list of
           controls can be found in the EVP_MAC implementation documentation.
           Common control strings used for this command are:

           key:string
               Specifies the MAC key as an alphanumeric string (use if the key
               contains printable characters only).  The string length must
               conform to any restrictions of the MAC algorithm.  A key must
               be specified for every MAC algorithm.  If no key is provided,
               the default that was specified when OpenSSL was configured is
               used.

           hexkey:string
               Specifies the MAC key in hexadecimal form (two hex digits per
               byte).  The key length must conform to any restrictions of the
               MAC algorithm.  A key must be specified for every MAC
               algorithm.  If no key is provided, the default that was
               specified when OpenSSL was configured is used.

           digest:string
               Used by HMAC as an alphanumeric string (use if the key contains
               printable characters only).  The string length must conform to
               any restrictions of the MAC algorithm.  To see the list of
               supported digests, use the command "openssl list
               -digest-commands".  The default digest is SHA-256.

       -noout
           Disable logging of the self tests.

       -no_conditional_errors
           Configure the module to not enter an error state if a conditional
           self test fails as described above.

       -no_security_checks
           Configure the module to not perform run-time security checks as
           described above.

       -self_test_onload
           Do not write the two fields related to the "test status indicator"
           and "MAC status indicator" to the output configuration file.
           Without these fields the self tests KATS will run each time the
           module is loaded. This option could be used for cross compiling,
           since the self tests need to run at least once on each target
           machine. Once the self tests have run on the target machine the
           user could possibly then add the 2 fields into the configuration
           using some other mechanism.

       -quiet
           Do not output pass/fail messages. Implies -noout.

       -corrupt_desc selftest_description, -corrupt_type selftest_type
           The corrupt options can be used to test failure of one or more self
           tests by name.  Either option or both may be used to select the
           tests to corrupt.  Refer to the entries for st-desc and st-type in
           OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS(7) for values that can be used.

       -config parent_config
           Test that a FIPS provider can be loaded from the specified
           configuration file.  A previous call to this application needs to
           generate the extra configuration data that is included by the base
           "parent_config" configuration file.  See config(5) for further
           information on how to set up a provider section.  All other options
           are ignored if '-config' is used.

NOTES
       Self tests results are logged by default if the options -quiet and
       -noout are not specified, or if either of the options -corrupt_desc or
       -corrupt_type are used.  If the base configuration file is set up to
       autoload the fips module, then the fips module will be loaded and self
       tested BEFORE the fipsinstall application has a chance to set up its
       own self test callback. As a result of this the self test output and
       the options -corrupt_desc and -corrupt_type will be ignored.  For
       normal usage the base configuration file should use the default
       provider when generating the fips configuration file.

EXAMPLES
       Calculate the mac of a FIPS module fips.so and run a FIPS self test for
       the module, and save the fips.cnf configuration file:

        openssl fipsinstall -module ./fips.so -out fips.cnf -provider_name fips

       Verify that the configuration file fips.cnf contains the correct info:

        openssl fipsinstall -module ./fips.so -in fips.cnf  -provider_name fips -verify

       Corrupt any self tests which have the description "SHA1":

        openssl fipsinstall -module ./fips.so -out fips.cnf -provider_name fips \
                -corrupt_desc 'SHA1'

       Validate that the fips module can be loaded from a base configuration
       file:

        export OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE=<path of configuration files>
        export OPENSSL_MODULES=<provider-path>
        openssl fipsinstall -config' 'default.cnf'
