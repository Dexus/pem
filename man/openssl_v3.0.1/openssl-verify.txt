DESCRIPTION
       This command verifies certificate chains. If a certificate chain has
       multiple problems, this program attempts to display all of them.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -CRLfile filename|uri
           The file or URI should contain one or more CRLs in PEM or DER
           format.  This option can be specified more than once to include
           CRLs from multiple sources.

       -crl_download
           Attempt to download CRL information for certificates via their CDP
           entries.

       -show_chain
           Display information about the certificate chain that has been built
           (if successful). Certificates in the chain that came from the
           untrusted list will be flagged as "untrusted".

       -verbose
           Print extra information about the operations being performed.

       -trusted filename|uri
           A file or URI of (more or less) trusted certificates.  See
           openssl-verification-options(1) for more information on trust
           settings.

           This option can be specified more than once to load certificates
           from multiple sources.

       -untrusted filename|uri
           A file or URI of untrusted certificates to use for chain building.
           This option can be specified more than once to load certificates
           from multiple sources.

       -vfyopt nm:v
           Pass options to the signature algorithm during verify operations.
           Names and values of these options are algorithm-specific.

       -nameopt option
           This specifies how the subject or issuer names are displayed.  See
           openssl-namedisplay-options(1) for details.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

           To load certificates or CRLs that require engine support, specify
           the -engine option before any of the -trusted, -untrusted or
           -CRLfile options.

       -CAfile file, -no-CAfile, -CApath dir, -no-CApath, -CAstore uri,
       -no-CAstore
           See "Trusted Certificate Options" in
           openssl-verification-options(1) for details.

       -allow_proxy_certs, -attime, -no_check_time, -check_ss_sig, -crl_check,
       -crl_check_all, -explicit_policy, -extended_crl, -ignore_critical,
       -inhibit_any, -inhibit_map, -no_alt_chains, -partial_chain, -policy,
       -policy_check, -policy_print, -purpose, -suiteB_128, -suiteB_128_only,
       -suiteB_192, -trusted_first, -use_deltas, -auth_level, -verify_depth,
       -verify_email, -verify_hostname, -verify_ip, -verify_name, -x509_strict
       -issuer_checks
           Set various options of certificate chain verification.  See
           "Verification Options" in openssl-verification-options(1) for
           details.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

       --  Indicates the last option. All arguments following this are assumed
           to be certificate files. This is useful if the first certificate
           filename begins with a -.

       certificate ...
           One or more target certificates to verify, one per file. If no
           certificates are given, this command will attempt to read a single
           certificate from standard input.

DIAGNOSTICS
       When a verify operation fails the output messages can be somewhat
       cryptic. The general form of the error message is:

        server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024 bit)
        error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate

       The first line contains the name of the certificate being verified
       followed by the subject name of the certificate. The second line
       contains the error number and the depth. The depth is number of the
       certificate being verified when a problem was detected starting with
       zero for the target ("leaf") certificate itself then 1 for the CA that
       signed the target certificate and so on.  Finally a textual version of
       the error number is presented.

       A list of the error codes and messages can be found in
       X509_STORE_CTX_get_error(3); the full list is defined in the header
       file <openssl/x509_vfy.h>.

       This command ignores many errors, in order to allow all the problems
       with a certificate chain to be determined.
