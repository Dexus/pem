OPENSSL-DHPARAM(1ossl)              OpenSSL             OPENSSL-DHPARAM(1ossl)



NAME
       openssl-dhparam - DH parameter manipulation and generation

SYNOPSIS
       openssl dhparam [-help] [-inform DER|PEM] [-outform DER|PEM] [-in
       filename] [-out filename] [-dsaparam] [-check] [-noout] [-text] [-2]
       [-3] [-5] [-engine id] [-rand files] [-writerand file] [-provider name]
       [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq] [numbits]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to manipulate DH parameter files.

       See "EXAMPLES" in openssl-genpkey(1) for examples on how to generate a
       key using a named safe prime group without generating intermediate
       parameters.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM, -outform DER|PEM
           The input format and output format; the default is PEM.  The object
           is compatible with the PKCS#3 DHparameter structure.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read parameters from or
           standard input if this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename parameters to. Standard output
           is used if this option is not present. The output filename should
           not be the same as the input filename.

       -dsaparam
           If this option is used, DSA rather than DH parameters are read or
           created; they are converted to DH format.  Otherwise, "strong"
           primes (such that (p-1)/2 is also prime) will be used for DH
           parameter generation.

           DH parameter generation with the -dsaparam option is much faster,
           and the recommended exponent length is shorter, which makes DH key
           exchange more efficient.  Beware that with such DSA-style DH
           parameters, a fresh DH key should be created for each use to avoid
           small-subgroup attacks that may be possible otherwise.

       -check
           Performs numerous checks to see if the supplied parameters are
           valid and displays a warning if not.

       -2, -3, -5
           The generator to use, either 2, 3 or 5. If present then the input
           file is ignored and parameters are generated instead. If not
           present but numbits is present, parameters are generated with the
           default generator 2.

       numbits
           This option specifies that a parameter set should be generated of
           size numbits. It must be the last option. If this option is present
           then the input file is ignored and parameters are generated
           instead. If this option is not present but a generator (-2, -3 or
           -5) is present, parameters are generated with a default length of
           2048 bits.  The minimim length is 512 bits. The maximum length is
           10000 bits.

       -noout
           This option inhibits the output of the encoded version of the
           parameters.

       -text
           This option prints out the DH parameters in human readable form.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

NOTES
       This command replaces the dh and gendh commands of previous releases.
