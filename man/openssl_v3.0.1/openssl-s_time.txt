DESCRIPTION
       This command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects to a
       remote host using SSL/TLS. It can request a page from the server and
       includes the time to transfer the payload data in its timing
       measurements.  It measures the number of connections within a given
       timeframe, the amount of data transferred (if any), and calculates the
       average time spent for one connection.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -connect host:port
           This specifies the host and optional port to connect to.

       -www page
           This specifies the page to GET from the server. A value of '/' gets
           the index.html page. If this parameter is not specified, then this
           command will only perform the handshake to establish SSL
           connections but not transfer any payload data.

       -cert certname
           The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server. The
           default is not to use a certificate. The file is in PEM format.

       -key keyfile
           The private key to use. If not specified then the certificate file
           will be used. The file is in PEM format.

       -verify depth
           The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length of the
           server certificate chain and turns on server certificate
           verification.  Currently the verify operation continues after
           errors so all the problems with a certificate chain can be seen. As
           a side effect the connection will never fail due to a server
           certificate verify failure.

       -new
           Performs the timing test using a new session ID for each
           connection.  If neither -new nor -reuse are specified, they are
           both on by default and executed in sequence.

       -reuse
           Performs the timing test using the same session ID; this can be
           used as a test that session caching is working. If neither -new nor
           -reuse are specified, they are both on by default and executed in
           sequence.

       -bugs
           There are several known bugs in SSL and TLS implementations. Adding
           this option enables various workarounds.

       -cipher cipherlist
           This allows the TLSv1.2 and below cipher list sent by the client to
           be modified.  This list will be combined with any TLSv1.3
           ciphersuites that have been configured. Although the server
           determines which cipher suite is used it should take the first
           supported cipher in the list sent by the client. See
           openssl-ciphers(1) for more information.

       -ciphersuites val
           This allows the TLSv1.3 ciphersuites sent by the client to be
           modified. This list will be combined with any TLSv1.2 and below
           ciphersuites that have been configured. Although the server
           determines which cipher suite is used it should take the first
           supported cipher in the list sent by the client. See
           openssl-ciphers(1) for more information. The format for this list
           is a simple colon (":") separated list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuite
           names.

       -time length
           Specifies how long (in seconds) this command should establish
           connections and optionally transfer payload data from a server.
           Server and client performance and the link speed determine how many
           connections it can establish.

       -nameopt option
           This specifies how the subject or issuer names are displayed.  See
           openssl-namedisplay-options(1) for details.

       -CAfile file, -no-CAfile, -CApath dir, -no-CApath, -CAstore uri,
       -no-CAstore
           See "Trusted Certificate Options" in
           openssl-verification-options(1) for details.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

       -cafile file
           This is an obsolete synonym for -CAfile.

       -ssl3, -tls1, -tls1_1, -tls1_2, -tls1_3
           See "TLS Version Options" in openssl(1).

NOTES
       This command can be used to measure the performance of an SSL
       connection.  To connect to an SSL HTTP server and get the default page
       the command

        openssl s_time -connect servername:443 -www / -CApath yourdir -CAfile yourfile.pem -cipher commoncipher [-ssl3]

       would typically be used (https uses port 443). commoncipher is a cipher
       to which both client and server can agree, see the openssl-ciphers(1)
       command for details.

       If the handshake fails then there are several possible causes, if it is
       nothing obvious like no client certificate then the -bugs and -ssl3
       options can be tried in case it is a buggy server. In particular you
       should play with these options before submitting a bug report to an
       OpenSSL mailing list.

       A frequent problem when attempting to get client certificates working
       is that a web client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
       list to choose from. This is normally because the server is not sending
       the clients certificate authority in its "acceptable CA list" when it
       requests a certificate. By using openssl-s_client(1) the CA list can be
       viewed and checked. However, some servers only request client
       authentication after a specific URL is requested. To obtain the list in
       this case it is necessary to use the -prexit option of
       openssl-s_client(1) and send an HTTP request for an appropriate page.

       If a certificate is specified on the command line using the -cert
       option it will not be used unless the server specifically requests a
       client certificate. Therefore, merely including a client certificate on
       the command line is no guarantee that the certificate works.

BUGS
       Because this program does not have all the options of the
       openssl-s_client(1) program to turn protocols on and off, you may not
       be able to measure the performance of all protocols with all servers.

       The -verify option should really exit if the server verification fails.

HISTORY
       The -cafile option was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
