OPENSSL-PKEYPARAM(1ossl)            OpenSSL           OPENSSL-PKEYPARAM(1ossl)



NAME
       openssl-pkeyparam - public key algorithm parameter processing command

SYNOPSIS
       openssl pkeyparam [-help] [-in filename] [-out filename] [-text]
       [-noout] [-check] [-engine id] [-provider name] [-provider-path path]
       [-propquery propq]

DESCRIPTION
       This command processes public key algorithm parameters.  They can be
       checked for correctness and their components printed out.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read parameters from or
           standard input if this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write parameters to or
           standard output if this option is not specified.

       -text
           Prints out the parameters in plain text in addition to the encoded
           version.

       -noout
           Do not output the encoded version of the parameters.

       -check
           This option checks the correctness of parameters.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

EXAMPLES
       Print out text version of parameters:

        openssl pkeyparam -in param.pem -text

NOTES
       There are no -inform or -outform options for this command because only
       PEM format is supported because the key type is determined by the PEM
       headers.
