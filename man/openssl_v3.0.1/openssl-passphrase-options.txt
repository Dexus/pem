NAME
       openssl-passphrase-options - Pass phrase options

SYNOPSIS
       openssl command [ options ... ] [ parameters ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Several OpenSSL commands accept password arguments, typically using
       -passin and -passout for input and output passwords respectively. These
       allow the password to be obtained from a variety of sources. Both of
       these options take a single argument whose format is described below.
       If no password argument is given and a password is required then the
       user is prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the
       current terminal with echoing turned off.

       Note that character encoding may be relevant, please see
       passphrase-encoding(7).

OPTIONS
   Pass Phrase Option Arguments
       Pass phrase arguments can be formatted as follows.

       pass:password
           The actual password is password. Since the password is visible to
           utilities (like 'ps' under Unix) this form should only be used
           where security is not important.

       env:var
           Obtain the password from the environment variable var. Since the
           environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms
           (e.g. ps under certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with
           caution.

       file:pathname
           The first line of pathname is the password. If the same pathname
           argument is supplied to -passin and -passout arguments then the
           first line will be used for the input password and the next line
           for the output password. pathname need not refer to a regular file:
           it could for example refer to a device or named pipe.

       fd:number
           Read the password from the file descriptor number. This can be used
           to send the data via a pipe for example.

       stdin
           Read the password from standard input.
