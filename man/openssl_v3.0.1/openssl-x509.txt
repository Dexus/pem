DESCRIPTION
       This command is a multi-purposes certificate handling command.  It can
       be used to print certificate information, convert certificates to
       various forms, edit certificate trust settings, generate certificates
       from scratch or from certificating requests and then self-signing them
       or signing them like a "micro CA".

       Since there are a large number of options they will split up into
       various sections.

OPTIONS
   Input, Output, and General Purpose Options
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -in filename|uri
           This specifies the input to read a certificate from or the input
           file for reading a certificate request if the -req flag is used.
           In both cases this defaults to standard input.

           This option cannot be combined with the -new flag.

       -passin arg
           The key and certificate file password source.  For more information
           about the format of arg see openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -new
           Generate a certificate from scratch, not using an input certificate
           or certificate request. So the -in option must not be used in this
           case.  Instead, the -subj option needs to be given.  The public key
           to include can be given with the -force_pubkey option and defaults
           to the key given with the -key (or -signkey) option, which implies
           self-signature.

       -x509toreq
           Output a PKCS#10 certificate request (rather than a certificate).
           The -key (or -signkey) option must be used to provide the private
           key for self-signing; the corresponding public key is placed in the
           subjectPKInfo field.

           X.509 extensions included in a certificate input are not copied by
           default.  X.509 extensions to be added can be specified using the
           -extfile option.

       -req
           By default a certificate is expected on input.  With this option a
           PKCS#10 certificate request is expected instead, which must be
           correctly self-signed.

           X.509 extensions included in the request are not copied by default.
           X.509 extensions to be added can be specified using the -extfile
           option.

       -copy_extensions arg
           Determines how to handle X.509 extensions when converting from a
           certificate to a request using the -x509toreq option or converting
           from a request to a certificate using the -req option.  If arg is
           none or this option is not present then extensions are ignored.  If
           arg is copy or copyall then all extensions are copied, except that
           subject identifier and authority key identifier extensions are not
           taken over when producing a certificate request.

           The -ext option can be used to further restrict which extensions to
           copy.

       -inform DER|PEM
           The input file format; unspecified by default.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -vfyopt nm:v
           Pass options to the signature algorithm during verify operations.
           Names and values of these options are algorithm-specific.

       -key filename|uri
           This option provides the private key for signing a new certificate
           or certificate request.  Unless -force_pubkey is given, the
           corresponding public key is placed in the new certificate or
           certificate request, resulting in a self-signature.

           This option cannot be used in conjunction with the -CA option.

           It sets the issuer name to the subject name (i.e., makes it self-
           issued) and changes the public key to the supplied value (unless
           overridden by -force_pubkey).  Unless the -preserve_dates option is
           supplied, it sets the validity start date to the current time and
           the end date to a value determined by the -days option.

       -signkey filename|uri
           This option is an alias of -key.

       -keyform DER|PEM|P12|ENGINE
           The key input format; unspecified by default.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write to or standard output
           by default.

       -outform DER|PEM
           The output format; the default is PEM.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -nocert
           Do not output a certificate (except for printing as requested by
           below options).

       -noout
           This option prevents output except for printing as requested by
           below options.

   Certificate Printing Options
       Note: the -alias and -purpose options are also printing options but are
       described in the "Trust Settings" section.

       -dateopt
           Specify the date output format. Values are: rfc_822 and iso_8601.
           Defaults to rfc_822.

       -text
           Prints out the certificate in text form. Full details are printed
           including the public key, signature algorithms, issuer and subject
           names, serial number any extensions present and any trust settings.

       -certopt option
           Customise the print format used with -text. The option argument can
           be a single option or multiple options separated by commas.  The
           -certopt switch may be also be used more than once to set multiple
           options. See the "Text Printing Flags" section for more
           information.

       -fingerprint
           Calculates and prints the digest of the DER encoded version of the
           entire certificate (see digest options).  This is commonly called a
           "fingerprint". Because of the nature of message digests, the
           fingerprint of a certificate is unique to that certificate and two
           certificates with the same fingerprint can be considered to be the
           same.

       -alias
           Prints the certificate "alias" (nickname), if any.

       -serial
           Prints the certificate serial number.

       -startdate
           Prints out the start date of the certificate, that is the notBefore
           date.

       -enddate
           Prints out the expiry date of the certificate, that is the notAfter
           date.

       -dates
           Prints out the start and expiry dates of a certificate.

       -subject
           Prints the subject name.

       -issuer
           Prints the issuer name.

       -nameopt option
           This specifies how the subject or issuer names are displayed.  See
           openssl-namedisplay-options(1) for details.

       -email
           Prints the email address(es) if any.

       -hash
           Synonym for "-subject_hash" for backward compatibility reasons.

       -subject_hash
           Prints the "hash" of the certificate subject name. This is used in
           OpenSSL to form an index to allow certificates in a directory to be
           looked up by subject name.

       -subject_hash_old
           Prints the "hash" of the certificate subject name using the older
           algorithm as used by OpenSSL before version 1.0.0.

       -issuer_hash
           Prints the "hash" of the certificate issuer name.

       -issuer_hash_old
           Prints the "hash" of the certificate issuer name using the older
           algorithm as used by OpenSSL before version 1.0.0.

       -ext extensions
           Prints out the certificate extensions in text form.  Can also be
           used to restrict which extensions to copy.  Extensions are
           specified with a comma separated string, e.g.,
           "subjectAltName,subjectKeyIdentifier".  See the x509v3_config(5)
           manual page for the extension names.

       -ocspid
           Prints the OCSP hash values for the subject name and public key.

       -ocsp_uri
           Prints the OCSP responder address(es) if any.

       -purpose
           This option performs tests on the certificate extensions and
           outputs the results. For a more complete description see
           "Certificate Extensions" in openssl-verification-options(1).

       -pubkey
           Prints the certificate's SubjectPublicKeyInfo block in PEM format.

       -modulus
           This option prints out the value of the modulus of the public key
           contained in the certificate.

   Certificate Checking Options
       -checkend arg
           Checks if the certificate expires within the next arg seconds and
           exits nonzero if yes it will expire or zero if not.

       -checkhost host
           Check that the certificate matches the specified host.

       -checkemail email
           Check that the certificate matches the specified email address.

       -checkip ipaddr
           Check that the certificate matches the specified IP address.

   Certificate Output Options
       -set_serial n
           Specifies the serial number to use.  This option can be used with
           the -key, -signkey, or -CA options.  If used in conjunction with
           the -CA option the serial number file (as specified by the
           -CAserial option) is not used.

           The serial number can be decimal or hex (if preceded by "0x").

       -next_serial
           Set the serial to be one more than the number in the certificate.

       -days arg
           Specifies the number of days until a newly generated certificate
           expires.  The default is 30.  Cannot be used together with the
           -preserve_dates option.

       -preserve_dates
           When signing a certificate, preserve "notBefore" and "notAfter"
           dates of any input certificate instead of adjusting them to current
           time and duration.  Cannot be used together with the -days option.

       -subj arg
           When a certificate is created set its subject name to the given
           value.  When the certificate is self-signed the issuer name is set
           to the same value.

           The arg must be formatted as
           "/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...".  Special characters may be
           escaped by "\" (backslash), whitespace is retained.  Empty values
           are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included in
           the certificate.  Giving a single "/" will lead to an empty
           sequence of RDNs (a NULL-DN).  Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by
           placing a "+" character instead of a "/" between the
           AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that specify the members of the
           set.  Example:

           "/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe"

           This option can be used in conjunction with the -force_pubkey
           option to create a certificate even without providing an input
           certificate or certificate request.

       -force_pubkey filename
           When a certificate is created set its public key to the key in
           filename instead of the key contained in the input or given with
           the -key (or -signkey) option.

           This option is useful for creating self-issued certificates that
           are not self-signed, for instance when the key cannot be used for
           signing, such as DH.  It can also be used in conjunction with
           b<-new> and -subj to directly generate a certificate containing any
           desired public key.

       -clrext
           When transforming a certificate to a new certificate by default all
           certificate extensions are retained.

           When transforming a certificate or certificate request, the -clrext
           option prevents taking over any extensions from the source.  In any
           case, when producing a certificate request, neither subject
           identifier nor authority key identifier extensions are included.

       -extfile filename
           Configuration file containing certificate and request X.509
           extensions to add.

       -extensions section
           The section in the extfile to add X.509 extensions from.  If this
           option is not specified then the extensions should either be
           contained in the unnamed (default) section or the default section
           should contain a variable called "extensions" which contains the
           section to use.  See the x509v3_config(5) manual page for details
           of the extension section format.

       -sigopt nm:v
           Pass options to the signature algorithm during sign operations.
           This option may be given multiple times.  Names and values provided
           using this option are algorithm-specific.

       -badsig
           Corrupt the signature before writing it; this can be useful for
           testing.

       -digest
           The digest to use.  This affects any signing or printing option
           that uses a message digest, such as the -fingerprint, -key, and -CA
           options.  Any digest supported by the openssl-dgst(1) command can
           be used.  If not specified then SHA1 is used with -fingerprint or
           the default digest for the signing algorithm is used, typically
           SHA256.

   Micro-CA Options
       -CA filename|uri
           Specifies the "CA" certificate to be used for signing.  When
           present, this behaves like a "micro CA" as follows: The subject
           name of the "CA" certificate is placed as issuer name in the new
           certificate, which is then signed using the "CA" key given as
           detailed below.

           This option cannot be used in conjunction with -key (or -signkey).
           This option is normally combined with the -req option referencing a
           CSR.  Without the -req option the input must be an existing
           certificate unless the -new option is given, which generates a
           certificate from scratch.

       -CAform DER|PEM|P12,
           The format for the CA certificate; unspecifed by default.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -CAkey filename|uri
           Sets the CA private key to sign a certificate with.  The private
           key must match the public key of the certificate given with -CA.
           If this option is not provided then the key must be present in the
           -CA input.

       -CAkeyform DER|PEM|P12|ENGINE
           The format for the CA key; unspecified by default.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -CAserial filename
           Sets the CA serial number file to use.

           When the -CA option is used to sign a certificate it uses a serial
           number specified in a file. This file consists of one line
           containing an even number of hex digits with the serial number to
           use. After each use the serial number is incremented and written
           out to the file again.

           The default filename consists of the CA certificate file base name
           with .srl appended. For example if the CA certificate file is
           called mycacert.pem it expects to find a serial number file called
           mycacert.srl.

       -CAcreateserial
           With this option the CA serial number file is created if it does
           not exist: it will contain the serial number "02" and the
           certificate being signed will have the 1 as its serial number. If
           the -CA option is specified and the serial number file does not
           exist a random number is generated; this is the recommended
           practice.

   Trust Settings
       A trusted certificate is an ordinary certificate which has several
       additional pieces of information attached to it such as the permitted
       and prohibited uses of the certificate and possibly an "alias"
       (nickname).

       Normally when a certificate is being verified at least one certificate
       must be "trusted". By default a trusted certificate must be stored
       locally and must be a root CA: any certificate chain ending in this CA
       is then usable for any purpose.

       Trust settings currently are only used with a root CA.  They allow a
       finer control over the purposes the root CA can be used for.  For
       example, a CA may be trusted for SSL client but not SSL server use.

       See openssl-verification-options(1) for more information on the meaning
       of trust settings.

       Future versions of OpenSSL will recognize trust settings on any
       certificate: not just root CAs.

       -trustout
           Mark any certificate PEM output as <trusted> certificate rather
           than ordinary.  An ordinary or trusted certificate can be input but
           by default an ordinary certificate is output and any trust settings
           are discarded.  With the -trustout option a trusted certificate is
           output. A trusted certificate is automatically output if any trust
           settings are modified.

       -setalias arg
           Sets the "alias" of the certificate. This will allow the
           certificate to be referred to using a nickname for example "Steve's
           Certificate".

       -clrtrust
           Clears all the permitted or trusted uses of the certificate.

       -addtrust arg
           Adds a trusted certificate use.  Any object name can be used here
           but currently only clientAuth, serverAuth, emailProtection, and
           anyExtendedKeyUsage are defined.  As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, the last of
           these blocks all purposes when rejected or enables all purposes
           when trusted.  Other OpenSSL applications may define additional
           uses.

       -clrreject
           Clears all the prohibited or rejected uses of the certificate.

       -addreject arg
           Adds a prohibited trust anchor purpose.  It accepts the same values
           as the -addtrust option.

   Generic options
       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

   Text Printing Flags
       As well as customising the name printing format, it is also possible to
       customise the actual fields printed using the certopt option when the
       text option is present. The default behaviour is to print all fields.

       compatible
           Use the old format. This is equivalent to specifying no printing
           options at all.

       no_header
           Don't print header information: that is the lines saying
           "Certificate" and "Data".

       no_version
           Don't print out the version number.

       no_serial
           Don't print out the serial number.

       no_signame
           Don't print out the signature algorithm used.

       no_validity
           Don't print the validity, that is the notBefore and notAfter
           fields.

       no_subject
           Don't print out the subject name.

       no_issuer
           Don't print out the issuer name.

       no_pubkey
           Don't print out the public key.

       no_sigdump
           Don't give a hexadecimal dump of the certificate signature.

       no_aux
           Don't print out certificate trust information.

       no_extensions
           Don't print out any X509V3 extensions.

       ext_default
           Retain default extension behaviour: attempt to print out
           unsupported certificate extensions.

       ext_error
           Print an error message for unsupported certificate extensions.

       ext_parse
           ASN1 parse unsupported extensions.

       ext_dump
           Hex dump unsupported extensions.

       ca_default
           The value used by openssl-ca(1), equivalent to no_issuer,
           no_pubkey, no_header, and no_version.

EXAMPLES
       Note: in these examples the '\' means the example should be all on one
       line.

       Print the contents of a certificate:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -text

       Print the "Subject Alternative Name" extension of a certificate:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -ext subjectAltName

       Print more extensions of a certificate:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -ext subjectAltName,nsCertType

       Print the certificate serial number:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -serial

       Print the certificate subject name:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -subject

       Print the certificate subject name in RFC2253 form:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -subject -nameopt RFC2253

       Print the certificate subject name in oneline form on a terminal
       supporting UTF8:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -subject -nameopt oneline,-esc_msb

       Print the certificate SHA1 fingerprint:

        openssl x509 -sha1 -in cert.pem -noout -fingerprint

       Convert a certificate from PEM to DER format:

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -inform PEM -out cert.der -outform DER

       Convert a certificate to a certificate request:

        openssl x509 -x509toreq -in cert.pem -out req.pem -key key.pem

       Convert a certificate request into a self-signed certificate using
       extensions for a CA:

        openssl x509 -req -in careq.pem -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions v3_ca \
               -key key.pem -out cacert.pem

       Sign a certificate request using the CA certificate above and add user
       certificate extensions:

        openssl x509 -req -in req.pem -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions v3_usr \
               -CA cacert.pem -CAkey key.pem -CAcreateserial

       Set a certificate to be trusted for SSL client use and change set its
       alias to "Steve's Class 1 CA"

        openssl x509 -in cert.pem -addtrust clientAuth \
               -setalias "Steve's Class 1 CA" -out trust.pem

NOTES
       The conversion to UTF8 format used with the name options assumes that
       T61Strings use the ISO8859-1 character set. This is wrong but Netscape
       and MSIE do this as do many certificates. So although this is incorrect
       it is more likely to print the majority of certificates correctly.

       The -email option searches the subject name and the subject alternative
       name extension. Only unique email addresses will be printed out: it
       will not print the same address more than once.

BUGS
       It is possible to produce invalid certificates or requests by
       specifying the wrong private key, using unsuitable X.509 extensions, or
       using inconsistent options in some cases: these should be checked.

       There should be options to explicitly set such things as start and end
       dates rather than an offset from the current time.

HISTORY
       The hash algorithm used in the -subject_hash and -issuer_hash options
       before OpenSSL 1.0.0 was based on the deprecated MD5 algorithm and the
       encoding of the distinguished name. In OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later it is
       based on a canonical version of the DN using SHA1. This means that any
       directories using the old form must have their links rebuilt using
       openssl-rehash(1) or similar.

       The -signkey option has been renamed to -key in OpenSSL 3.0, keeping
       the old name as an alias.

       The -engine option was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.

       The -C option was removed in OpenSSL 3.0.
