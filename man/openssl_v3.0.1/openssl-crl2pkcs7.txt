NAME
       openssl-crl2pkcs7 - Create a PKCS#7 structure from a CRL and
       certificates

SYNOPSIS
       openssl crl2pkcs7 [-help] [-inform DER|PEM] [-outform DER|PEM] [-in
       filename] [-out filename] [-certfile filename] [-nocrl] [-provider
       name] [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq]

DESCRIPTION
       This command takes an optional CRL and one or more certificates and
       converts them into a PKCS#7 degenerate "certificates only" structure.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM
           The input format of the CRL; the default is PEM.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -outform DER|PEM
           The output format of the PKCS#7 object; the default is PEM.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read a CRL from or standard
           input if this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           Specifies the output filename to write the PKCS#7 structure to or
           standard output by default.

       -certfile filename
           Specifies a filename containing one or more certificates in PEM
           format.  All certificates in the file will be added to the PKCS#7
           structure. This option can be used more than once to read
           certificates from multiple files.

       -nocrl
           Normally a CRL is included in the output file. With this option no
           CRL is included in the output file and a CRL is not read from the
           input file.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

EXAMPLES
       Create a PKCS#7 structure from a certificate and CRL:

        openssl crl2pkcs7 -in crl.pem -certfile cert.pem -out p7.pem

       Creates a PKCS#7 structure in DER format with no CRL from several
       different certificates:

        openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile newcert.pem
               -certfile demoCA/cacert.pem -outform DER -out p7.der

NOTES
       The output file is a PKCS#7 signed data structure containing no signers
       and just certificates and an optional CRL.

       This command can be used to send certificates and CAs to Netscape as
       part of the certificate enrollment process. This involves sending the
       DER encoded output as MIME type application/x-x509-user-cert.

       The PEM encoded form with the header and footer lines removed can be
       used to install user certificates and CAs in MSIE using the Xenroll
       control.
