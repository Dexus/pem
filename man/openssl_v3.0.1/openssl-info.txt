OPENSSL-INFO(1ossl)                 OpenSSL                OPENSSL-INFO(1ossl)



NAME
       openssl-info - print OpenSSL built-in information

SYNOPSIS
       openssl info [-help] [-configdir] [-enginesdir] [-modulesdir ]
       [-dsoext] [-dirnamesep] [-listsep] [-seeds] [-cpusettings]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to print out information about OpenSSL.  The
       information is written exactly as it is with no extra text, which makes
       useful for scripts.

       As a consequence, only one item may be chosen for each run of this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -configdir
           Outputs the default directory for OpenSSL configuration files.

       -enginesdir
           Outputs the default directory for OpenSSL engine modules.

       -modulesdir
           Outputs the default directory for OpenSSL dynamically loadable
           modules other than engine modules.

       -dsoext
           Outputs the DSO extension OpenSSL uses.

       -dirnamesep
           Outputs the separator character between a directory specification
           and a filename.  Note that on some operating systems, this is not
           the same as the separator between directory elements.

       -listsep
           Outputs the OpenSSL list separator character.  This is typically
           used to construct $PATH ("%PATH%" on Windows) style lists.

       -seeds
           Outputs the randomness seed sources.

       -cpusettings
           Outputs the OpenSSL CPU settings info.
