OPENSSL-STOREUTL(1ossl)             OpenSSL            OPENSSL-STOREUTL(1ossl)



NAME
       openssl-storeutl - STORE command

SYNOPSIS
       openssl storeutl [-help] [-out file] [-noout] [-passin arg] [-text arg]
       [-r] [-certs] [-keys] [-crls] [-subject arg] [-issuer arg] [-serial
       arg] [-alias arg] [-fingerprint arg] [-digest] [-engine id] [-provider
       name] [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq] uri ...

DESCRIPTION
       This command can be used to display the contents (after decryption as
       the case may be) fetched from the given URIs.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out filename
           specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
           default.

       -noout
           this option prevents output of the PEM data.

       -passin arg
           the key password source. For more information about the format of
           arg see openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -text
           Prints out the objects in text form, similarly to the -text output
           from openssl-x509(1), openssl-pkey(1), etc.

       -r  Fetch objects recursively when possible.

       -certs
       -keys
       -crls
           Only select the certificates, keys or CRLs from the given URI.
           However, if this URI would return a set of names (URIs), those are
           always returned.

       -subject arg
           Search for an object having the subject name arg.

           The arg must be formatted as
           "/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...".  Special characters may be
           escaped by "\" (backslash), whitespace is retained.  Empty values
           are permitted but are ignored for the search.  That is, a search
           with an empty value will have the same effect as not specifying the
           type at all.  Giving a single "/" will lead to an empty sequence of
           RDNs (a NULL-DN).  Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a "+"
           character instead of a "/" between the AttributeValueAssertions
           (AVAs) that specify the members of the set.

           Example:

           "/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe"

       -issuer arg
       -serial arg
           Search for an object having the given issuer name and serial
           number.  These two options must be used together.  The issuer arg
           must be formatted as "/type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...",
           characters may be escaped by \ (backslash), no spaces are skipped.
           The serial arg may be specified as a decimal value or a hex value
           if preceded by "0x".

       -alias arg
           Search for an object having the given alias.

       -fingerprint arg
           Search for an object having the given fingerprint.

       -digest
           The digest that was used to compute the fingerprint given with
           -fingerprint.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).
