DESCRIPTION
       This command processes RSA keys. They can be converted between various
       forms and their components printed out.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM|P12|ENGINE
           The key input format; unspecified by default.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -outform DER|PEM
           The key output format; the default is PEM.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

       -traditional
           When writing a private key, use the traditional PKCS#1 format
           instead of the PKCS#8 format.

       -in filename|uri
           This specifies the input to read a key from or standard input if
           this option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a pass phrase
           will be prompted for.

       -passin arg, -passout arg
           The password source for the input and output file.  For more
           information about the format of arg see
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -out filename
           This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard
           output if this option is not specified. If any encryption options
           are set then a pass phrase will be prompted for. The output
           filename should not be the same as the input filename.

       -aes128, -aes192, -aes256, -aria128, -aria192, -aria256, -camellia128,
       -camellia192, -camellia256, -des, -des3, -idea
           These options encrypt the private key with the specified cipher
           before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.  If none of
           these options is specified the key is written in plain text. This
           means that this command can be used to remove the pass phrase from
           a key by not giving any encryption option is given, or to add or
           change the pass phrase by setting them.  These options can only be
           used with PEM format output files.

       -text
           Prints out the various public or private key components in plain
           text in addition to the encoded version.

       -noout
           This option prevents output of the encoded version of the key.

       -modulus
           This option prints out the value of the modulus of the key.

       -check
           This option checks the consistency of an RSA private key.

       -pubin
           By default a private key is read from the input file: with this
           option a public key is read instead.

       -pubout
           By default a private key is output: with this option a public key
           will be output instead. This option is automatically set if the
           input is a public key.

       -RSAPublicKey_in, -RSAPublicKey_out
           Like -pubin and -pubout except RSAPublicKey format is used instead.

       -pvk-strong
           Enable 'Strong' PVK encoding level (default).

       -pvk-weak
           Enable 'Weak' PVK encoding level.

       -pvk-none
           Don't enforce PVK encoding.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

NOTES
       The openssl-pkey(1) command is capable of performing all the operations
       this command can, as well as supporting other public key types.

EXAMPLES
       The documentation for the openssl-pkey(1) command contains examples
       equivalent to the ones listed here.

       To remove the pass phrase on an RSA private key:

        openssl rsa -in key.pem -out keyout.pem

       To encrypt a private key using triple DES:

        openssl rsa -in key.pem -des3 -out keyout.pem

       To convert a private key from PEM to DER format:

        openssl rsa -in key.pem -outform DER -out keyout.der

       To print out the components of a private key to standard output:

        openssl rsa -in key.pem -text -noout

       To just output the public part of a private key:

        openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem

       Output the public part of a private key in RSAPublicKey format:

        openssl rsa -in key.pem -RSAPublicKey_out -out pubkey.pem

BUGS
       There should be an option that automatically handles .key files,
       without having to manually edit them.
