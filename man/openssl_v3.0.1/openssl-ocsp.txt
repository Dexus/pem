DESCRIPTION
       The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enables applications to
       determine the (revocation) state of an identified certificate (RFC
       2560).

       This command performs many common OCSP tasks. It can be used to print
       out requests and responses, create requests and send queries to an OCSP
       responder and behave like a mini OCSP server itself.

OPTIONS
       This command operates as either a client or a server.  The options are
       described below, divided into those two modes.

   OCSP Client Options
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out filename
           specify output filename, default is standard output.

       -issuer filename
           This specifies the current issuer certificate. This option can be
           used multiple times.  This option MUST come before any -cert
           options.

       -cert filename
           Add the certificate filename to the request. The issuer certificate
           is taken from the previous -issuer option, or an error occurs if no
           issuer certificate is specified.

       -no_certs
           Don't include any certificates in signed request.

       -serial num
           Same as the -cert option except the certificate with serial number
           num is added to the request. The serial number is interpreted as a
           decimal integer unless preceded by "0x". Negative integers can also
           be specified by preceding the value by a "-" sign.

       -signer filename, -signkey filename
           Sign the OCSP request using the certificate specified in the
           -signer option and the private key specified by the -signkey
           option. If the -signkey option is not present then the private key
           is read from the same file as the certificate. If neither option is
           specified then the OCSP request is not signed.

       -sign_other filename
           Additional certificates to include in the signed request.  The
           input can be in PEM, DER, or PKCS#12 format.

       -nonce, -no_nonce
           Add an OCSP nonce extension to a request or disable OCSP nonce
           addition.  Normally if an OCSP request is input using the -reqin
           option no nonce is added: using the -nonce option will force
           addition of a nonce.  If an OCSP request is being created (using
           -cert and -serial options) a nonce is automatically added
           specifying -no_nonce overrides this.

       -req_text, -resp_text, -text
           Print out the text form of the OCSP request, response or both
           respectively.

       -reqout file, -respout file
           Write out the DER encoded certificate request or response to file.

       -reqin file, -respin file
           Read OCSP request or response file from file. These option are
           ignored if OCSP request or response creation is implied by other
           options (for example with -serial, -cert and -host options).

       -url responder_url
           Specify the responder URL. Both HTTP and HTTPS (SSL/TLS) URLs can
           be specified.  The optional userinfo and fragment components are
           ignored.  Any given query component is handled as part of the path
           component.

       -host hostname:port, -path pathname
           If the -host option is present then the OCSP request is sent to the
           host hostname on port port. The -path option specifies the HTTP
           pathname to use or "/" by default.  This is equivalent to
           specifying -url with scheme http:// and the given hostname, port,
           and pathname.

       -proxy [http[s]://][userinfo@]host[:port][/path]
           The HTTP(S) proxy server to use for reaching the OCSP server unless
           -no_proxy applies, see below.  The proxy port defaults to 80 or 443
           if the scheme is "https"; apart from that the optional "http://" or
           "https://" prefix is ignored, as well as any userinfo and path
           components.  Defaults to the environment variable "http_proxy" if
           set, else "HTTP_PROXY" in case no TLS is used, otherwise
           "https_proxy" if set, else "HTTPS_PROXY".

       -no_proxy addresses
           List of IP addresses and/or DNS names of servers not to use an
           HTTP(S) proxy for, separated by commas and/or whitespace (where in
           the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
           Default is from the environment variable "no_proxy" if set, else
           "NO_PROXY".

       -header name=value
           Adds the header name with the specified value to the OCSP request
           that is sent to the responder.  This may be repeated.

       -timeout seconds
           Connection timeout to the OCSP responder in seconds.  On POSIX
           systems, when running as an OCSP responder, this option also limits
           the time that the responder is willing to wait for the client
           request.  This time is measured from the time the responder accepts
           the connection until the complete request is received.

       -verify_other file
           File or URI containing additional certificates to search when
           attempting to locate the OCSP response signing certificate. Some
           responders omit the actual signer's certificate from the response:
           this option can be used to supply the necessary certificate in such
           cases.  The input can be in PEM, DER, or PKCS#12 format.

       -trust_other
           The certificates specified by the -verify_other option should be
           explicitly trusted and no additional checks will be performed on
           them. This is useful when the complete responder certificate chain
           is not available or trusting a root CA is not appropriate.

       -VAfile file
           File or URI containing explicitly trusted responder certificates.
           Equivalent to the -verify_other and -trust_other options.  The
           input can be in PEM, DER, or PKCS#12 format.

       -noverify
           Don't attempt to verify the OCSP response signature or the nonce
           values. This option will normally only be used for debugging since
           it disables all verification of the responders certificate.

       -no_intern
           Ignore certificates contained in the OCSP response when searching
           for the signers certificate. With this option the signers
           certificate must be specified with either the -verify_other or
           -VAfile options.

       -no_signature_verify
           Don't check the signature on the OCSP response. Since this option
           tolerates invalid signatures on OCSP responses it will normally
           only be used for testing purposes.

       -no_cert_verify
           Don't verify the OCSP response signers certificate at all. Since
           this option allows the OCSP response to be signed by any
           certificate it should only be used for testing purposes.

       -no_chain
           Do not use certificates in the response as additional untrusted CA
           certificates.

       -no_explicit
           Do not explicitly trust the root CA if it is set to be trusted for
           OCSP signing.

       -no_cert_checks
           Don't perform any additional checks on the OCSP response signers
           certificate.  That is do not make any checks to see if the signers
           certificate is authorised to provide the necessary status
           information: as a result this option should only be used for
           testing purposes.

       -validity_period nsec, -status_age age
           These options specify the range of times, in seconds, which will be
           tolerated in an OCSP response. Each certificate status response
           includes a notBefore time and an optional notAfter time. The
           current time should fall between these two values, but the interval
           between the two times may be only a few seconds. In practice the
           OCSP responder and clients clocks may not be precisely synchronised
           and so such a check may fail. To avoid this the -validity_period
           option can be used to specify an acceptable error range in seconds,
           the default value is 5 minutes.

           If the notAfter time is omitted from a response then this means
           that new status information is immediately available. In this case
           the age of the notBefore field is checked to see it is not older
           than age seconds old.  By default this additional check is not
           performed.

       -rcid digest
           This option sets the digest algorithm to use for certificate
           identification in the OCSP response. Any digest supported by the
           openssl-dgst(1) command can be used. The default is the same digest
           algorithm used in the request.

       -digest
           This option sets digest algorithm to use for certificate
           identification in the OCSP request. Any digest supported by the
           OpenSSL dgst command can be used.  The default is SHA-1. This
           option may be used multiple times to specify the digest used by
           subsequent certificate identifiers.

       -CAfile file, -no-CAfile, -CApath dir, -no-CApath, -CAstore uri,
       -no-CAstore
           See "Trusted Certificate Options" in
           openssl-verification-options(1) for details.

           Set various options of certificate chain verification.  See
           "Verification Options" in openssl-verification-options(1) for
           details.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

   OCSP Server Options
       -index indexfile
           The indexfile parameter is the name of a text index file in ca
           format containing certificate revocation information.

           If the -index option is specified then this command switches to
           responder mode, otherwise it is in client mode. The request(s) the
           responder processes can be either specified on the command line
           (using -issuer and -serial options), supplied in a file (using the
           -reqin option) or via external OCSP clients (if -port or -url is
           specified).

           If the -index option is present then the -CA and -rsigner options
           must also be present.

       -CA file
           CA certificate corresponding to the revocation information in the
           index file given with -index.  The input can be in PEM, DER, or
           PKCS#12 format.

       -rsigner file
           The certificate to sign OCSP responses with.

       -rkey file
           The private key to sign OCSP responses with: if not present the
           file specified in the -rsigner option is used.

       -passin arg
           The private key password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -rother file
           Additional certificates to include in the OCSP response.  The input
           can be in PEM, DER, or PKCS#12 format.

       -rsigopt nm:v
           Pass options to the signature algorithm when signing OCSP
           responses.  Names and values of these options are algorithm-
           specific.

       -rmd digest
           The digest to use when signing the response.

       -badsig
           Corrupt the response signature before writing it; this can be
           useful for testing.

       -resp_no_certs
           Don't include any certificates in the OCSP response.

       -resp_key_id
           Identify the signer certificate using the key ID, default is to use
           the subject name.

       -port portnum
           Port to listen for OCSP requests on. The port may also be specified
           using the url option.  A 0 argument indicates that any available
           port shall be chosen automatically.

       -ignore_err
           Ignore malformed requests or responses: When acting as an OCSP
           client, retry if a malformed response is received. When acting as
           an OCSP responder, continue running instead of terminating upon
           receiving a malformed request.

       -nrequest number
           The OCSP server will exit after receiving number requests, default
           unlimited.

       -multi process-count
           Run the specified number of OCSP responder child processes, with
           the parent process respawning child processes as needed.  Child
           processes will detect changes in the CA index file and
           automatically reload it.  When running as a responder -timeout
           option is recommended to limit the time each child is willing to
           wait for the client's OCSP response.  This option is available on
           POSIX systems (that support the fork() and other required unix
           system-calls).

       -nmin minutes, -ndays days
           Number of minutes or days when fresh revocation information is
           available: used in the nextUpdate field. If neither option is
           present then the nextUpdate field is omitted meaning fresh
           revocation information is immediately available.

OCSP RESPONSE VERIFICATION
       OCSP Response follows the rules specified in RFC2560.

       Initially the OCSP responder certificate is located and the signature
       on the OCSP request checked using the responder certificate's public
       key.

       Then a normal certificate verify is performed on the OCSP responder
       certificate building up a certificate chain in the process. The
       locations of the trusted certificates used to build the chain can be
       specified by the -CAfile, -CApath or -CAstore options or they will be
       looked for in the standard OpenSSL certificates directory.

       If the initial verify fails then the OCSP verify process halts with an
       error.

       Otherwise the issuing CA certificate in the request is compared to the
       OCSP responder certificate: if there is a match then the OCSP verify
       succeeds.

       Otherwise the OCSP responder certificate's CA is checked against the
       issuing CA certificate in the request. If there is a match and the
       OCSPSigning extended key usage is present in the OCSP responder
       certificate then the OCSP verify succeeds.

       Otherwise, if -no_explicit is not set the root CA of the OCSP
       responders CA is checked to see if it is trusted for OCSP signing. If
       it is the OCSP verify succeeds.

       If none of these checks is successful then the OCSP verify fails.

       What this effectively means if that if the OCSP responder certificate
       is authorised directly by the CA it is issuing revocation information
       about (and it is correctly configured) then verification will succeed.

       If the OCSP responder is a "global responder" which can give details
       about multiple CAs and has its own separate certificate chain then its
       root CA can be trusted for OCSP signing. For example:

        openssl x509 -in ocspCA.pem -addtrust OCSPSigning -out trustedCA.pem

       Alternatively the responder certificate itself can be explicitly
       trusted with the -VAfile option.

NOTES
       As noted, most of the verify options are for testing or debugging
       purposes.  Normally only the -CApath, -CAfile, -CAstore and (if the
       responder is a 'global VA') -VAfile options need to be used.

       The OCSP server is only useful for test and demonstration purposes: it
       is not really usable as a full OCSP responder. It contains only a very
       simple HTTP request handling and can only handle the POST form of OCSP
       queries. It also handles requests serially meaning it cannot respond to
       new requests until it has processed the current one. The text index
       file format of revocation is also inefficient for large quantities of
       revocation data.

       It is possible to run this command in responder mode via a CGI script
       using the -reqin and -respout options.

EXAMPLES
       Create an OCSP request and write it to a file:

        openssl ocsp -issuer issuer.pem -cert c1.pem -cert c2.pem -reqout req.der

       Send a query to an OCSP responder with URL http://ocsp.myhost.com/ save
       the response to a file, print it out in text form, and verify the
       response:

        openssl ocsp -issuer issuer.pem -cert c1.pem -cert c2.pem \
            -url http://ocsp.myhost.com/ -resp_text -respout resp.der

       Read in an OCSP response and print out text form:

        openssl ocsp -respin resp.der -text -noverify

       OCSP server on port 8888 using a standard ca configuration, and a
       separate responder certificate. All requests and responses are printed
       to a file.

        openssl ocsp -index demoCA/index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner rcert.pem -CA demoCA/cacert.pem
               -text -out log.txt

       As above but exit after processing one request:

        openssl ocsp -index demoCA/index.txt -port 8888 -rsigner rcert.pem -CA demoCA/cacert.pem
            -nrequest 1

       Query status information using an internally generated request:

        openssl ocsp -index demoCA/index.txt -rsigner rcert.pem -CA demoCA/cacert.pem
            -issuer demoCA/cacert.pem -serial 1

       Query status information using request read from a file, and write the
       response to a second file.

        openssl ocsp -index demoCA/index.txt -rsigner rcert.pem -CA demoCA/cacert.pem
            -reqin req.der -respout resp.der
