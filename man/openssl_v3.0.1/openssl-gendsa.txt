NAME
       openssl-gendsa - generate a DSA private key from a set of parameters

SYNOPSIS
       openssl gendsa [-help] [-out filename] [-passout arg] [-aes128]
       [-aes192] [-aes256] [-aria128] [-aria192] [-aria256] [-camellia128]
       [-camellia192] [-camellia256] [-des] [-des3] [-idea] [-verbose] [-rand
       files] [-writerand file] [-engine id] [-provider name] [-provider-path
       path] [-propquery propq] [paramfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This command generates a DSA private key from a DSA parameter file
       (which will be typically generated by the openssl-dsaparam(1) command).

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out filename
           Output the key to the specified file. If this argument is not
           specified then standard output is used.

       -passout arg
           The passphrase used for the output file.  See
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -aes128, -aes192, -aes256, -aria128, -aria192, -aria256, -camellia128,
       -camellia192, -camellia256, -des, -des3, -idea
           These options encrypt the private key with specified cipher before
           outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.  If none of these
           options is specified no encryption is used.

       -verbose
           Print extra details about the operations being performed.

       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       paramfile
           The DSA parameter file to use. The parameters in this file
           determine the size of the private key. DSA parameters can be
           generated and examined using the openssl-dsaparam(1) command.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

NOTES
       DSA key generation is little more than random number generation so it
       is much quicker that RSA key generation for example.
