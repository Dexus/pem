NAME
       openssl-nseq - create or examine a Netscape certificate sequence

SYNOPSIS
       openssl nseq [-help] [-in filename] [-out filename] [-toseq] [-provider
       name] [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq]

DESCRIPTION
       This command takes a file containing a Netscape certificate sequence
       and prints out the certificates contained in it or takes a file of
       certificates and converts it into a Netscape certificate sequence.

       A Netscape certificate sequence is an old Netscape-specific format that
       can be sometimes be sent to browsers as an alternative to the standard
       PKCS#7 format when several certificates are sent to the browser, for
       example during certificate enrollment.  It was also used by Netscape
       certificate server.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read or standard input if this
           option is not specified.

       -out filename
           Specifies the output filename or standard output by default.

       -toseq
           Normally a Netscape certificate sequence will be input and the
           output is the certificates contained in it. With the -toseq option
           the situation is reversed: a Netscape certificate sequence is
           created from a file of certificates.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

EXAMPLES
       Output the certificates in a Netscape certificate sequence

        openssl nseq -in nseq.pem -out certs.pem

       Create a Netscape certificate sequence

        openssl nseq -in certs.pem -toseq -out nseq.pem
