OPENSSL-ENGINE(1ossl)               OpenSSL              OPENSSL-ENGINE(1ossl)



NAME
       openssl-engine - load and query engines

SYNOPSIS
       openssl engine [-help] [-v] [-vv] [-vvv] [-vvvv] [-c] [-t] [-tt] [-pre
       command] ...  [-post command] ...  [engine ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command has been deprecated.  Providers should be used instead of
       engines.

       This command is used to query the status and capabilities of the
       specified engines.  Engines may be specified before and after all other
       command-line flags.  Only those specified are queried.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Display an option summary.

       -v -vv -vvv -vvvv
           Provides information about each specified engine. The first flag
           lists all the possible run-time control commands; the second adds a
           description of each command; the third adds the input flags, and
           the final option adds the internal input flags.

       -c  Lists the capabilities of each engine.

       -t  Tests if each specified engine is available, and displays the
           answer.

       -tt Displays an error trace for any unavailable engine.

       -pre command
       -post command
           Command-line configuration of engines.  The -pre command is given
           to the engine before it is loaded and the -post command is given
           after the engine is loaded.  The command is of the form cmd:val
           where cmd is the command, and val is the value for the command.
           See the example below.

           These two options are cumulative, so they may be given more than
           once in the same command.

EXAMPLES
       To list all the commands available to a dynamic engine:

        $ openssl engine -t -tt -vvvv dynamic
        (dynamic) Dynamic engine loading support
             [ unavailable ]
             SO_PATH: Specifies the path to the new ENGINE shared library
                  (input flags): STRING
             NO_VCHECK: Specifies to continue even if version checking fails (boolean)
                  (input flags): NUMERIC
             ID: Specifies an ENGINE id name for loading
                  (input flags): STRING
             LIST_ADD: Whether to add a loaded ENGINE to the internal list (0=no,1=yes,2=mandatory)
                  (input flags): NUMERIC
             DIR_LOAD: Specifies whether to load from 'DIR_ADD' directories (0=no,1=yes,2=mandatory)
                  (input flags): NUMERIC
             DIR_ADD: Adds a directory from which ENGINEs can be loaded
                  (input flags): STRING
             LOAD: Load up the ENGINE specified by other settings
                  (input flags): NO_INPUT

       To list the capabilities of the rsax engine:

        $ openssl engine -c
        (rsax) RSAX engine support
         [RSA]
        (dynamic) Dynamic engine loading support

ENVIRONMENT
       OPENSSL_ENGINES
           The path to the engines directory.
