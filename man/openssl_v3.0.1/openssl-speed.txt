DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to test the performance of cryptographic
       algorithms.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -elapsed
           When calculating operations- or bytes-per-second, use wall-clock
           time instead of CPU user time as divisor. It can be useful when
           testing speed of hardware engines.

       -evp algo
           Use the specified cipher or message digest algorithm via the EVP
           interface.  If algo is an AEAD cipher, then you can pass -aead to
           benchmark a TLS-like sequence. And if algo is a multi-buffer
           capable cipher, e.g.  aes-128-cbc-hmac-sha1, then -mb will time
           multi-buffer operation.

           To see the algorithms supported with this option, use "openssl list
           -digest-algorithms" or "openssl list -cipher-algorithms" command.

       -multi num
           Run multiple operations in parallel.

       -async_jobs num
           Enable async mode and start specified number of jobs.

       -misalign num
           Misalign the buffers by the specified number of bytes.

       -hmac digest
           Time the HMAC algorithm using the specified message digest.

       -cmac cipher
           Time the CMAC algorithm using the specified cipher e.g.  "openssl
           speed -cmac aes128".

       -decrypt
           Time the decryption instead of encryption. Affects only the EVP
           testing.

       -mb Enable multi-block mode on EVP-named cipher.

       -aead
           Benchmark EVP-named AEAD cipher in TLS-like sequence.

       -primes num
           Generate a num-prime RSA key and use it to run the benchmarks. This
           option is only effective if RSA algorithm is specified to test.

       -seconds num
           Run benchmarks for num seconds.

       -bytes num
           Run benchmarks on num-byte buffers. Affects ciphers, digests and
           the CSPRNG.

       -mr Produce the summary in a mechanical, machine-readable, format.

       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

       algorithm ...
           If any algorithm is given, then those algorithms are tested,
           otherwise a pre-compiled grand selection is tested.

BUGS
       The algorithm can be selected only from a pre-compiled subset of things
       that the "openssl speed" command knows about. To test any additional
       digest or cipher algorithm supported by OpenSSL use the "-evp" option.

       There is no way to test the speed of any additional public key
       algorithms supported by third party providers with the "openssl speed"
       command.

HISTORY
       The -engine option was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
