NAME
       openssl-format-options - OpenSSL command input and output format
       options

SYNOPSIS
       openssl command [ options ... ] [ parameters ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Several OpenSSL commands can take input or generate output in a variety
       of formats.

       Since OpenSSL 3.0 keys, single certificates, and CRLs can be read from
       files in any of the DER, PEM or P12 formats. Specifying their input
       format is no more needed and the openssl commands will automatically
       try all the possible formats. However if the DER or PEM input format is
       specified it will be enforced.

       In order to access a key via an engine the input format ENGINE may be
       used; alternatively the key identifier in the <uri> argument of the
       respective key option may be preceded by "org.openssl.engine:".  See
       "Engine Options" in openssl(1) for an example usage of the latter.

OPTIONS
   Format Options
       The options to specify the format are as follows.  Refer to the
       individual man page to see which options are accepted.

       -inform format, -outform format
           The format of the input or output streams.

       -keyform format
           Format of a private key input source.

       -CRLform format
           Format of a CRL input source.

   Format Option Arguments
       The possible format arguments are described below.  Both uppercase and
       lowercase are accepted.

       The list of acceptable format arguments, and the default, is described
       in each command documentation.

       DER A binary format, encoded or parsed according to Distinguished
           Encoding Rules (DER) of the ASN.1 data language.

       ENGINE
           Used to specify that the cryptographic material is in an OpenSSL
           engine.  An engine must be configured or specified using the
           -engine option.  A password or PIN may be supplied to the engine
           using the -passin option.

       P12 A DER-encoded file containing a PKCS#12 object.  It might be
           necessary to provide a decryption password to retrieve the private
           key.

       PEM A text format defined in IETF RFC 1421 and IETF RFC 7468. Briefly,
           this is a block of base-64 encoding (defined in IETF RFC 4648),
           with specific lines used to mark the start and end:

            Text before the BEGIN line is ignored.
            ----- BEGIN object-type -----
            OT43gQKBgQC/2OHZoko6iRlNOAQ/tMVFNq7fL81GivoQ9F1U0Qr+DH3ZfaH8eIkX
            xT0ToMPJUzWAn8pZv0snA0um6SIgvkCuxO84OkANCVbttzXImIsL7pFzfcwV/ERK
            UM6j0ZuSMFOCr/lGPAoOQU0fskidGEHi1/kW+suSr28TqsyYZpwBDQ==
            ----- END object-type -----
            Text after the END line is also ignored

           The object-type must match the type of object that is expected.
           For example a "BEGIN X509 CERTIFICATE" will not match if the
           command is trying to read a private key. The types supported
           include:

            ANY PRIVATE KEY
            CERTIFICATE
            CERTIFICATE REQUEST
            CMS
            DH PARAMETERS
            DSA PARAMETERS
            DSA PUBLIC KEY
            EC PARAMETERS
            EC PRIVATE KEY
            ECDSA PUBLIC KEY
            ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY
            PARAMETERS
            PKCS #7 SIGNED DATA
            PKCS7
            PRIVATE KEY
            PUBLIC KEY
            RSA PRIVATE KEY
            SSL SESSION PARAMETERS
            TRUSTED CERTIFICATE
            X509 CRL
            X9.42 DH PARAMETERS

           The following legacy object-type's are also supported for
           compatibility with earlier releases:

            DSA PRIVATE KEY
            NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST
            RSA PUBLIC KEY
            X509 CERTIFICATE

       SMIME
           An S/MIME object as described in IETF RFC 8551.  Earlier versions
           were known as CMS and are compatible.  Note that the parsing is
           simple and might fail to parse some legal data.
