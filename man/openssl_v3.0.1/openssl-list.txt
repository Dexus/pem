DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to generate list of algorithms or disabled
       features.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Display a usage message.

       -verbose
           Displays extra information.  The options below where verbosity
           applies say a bit more about what that means.

       -select name
           Only list algorithms that match this name.

       -1  List the commands, digest-commands, or cipher-commands in a single
           column.  If used, this option must be given first.

       -commands
           Display a list of standard commands.

       -standard-commands
           List of standard commands.

       -digest-commands
           This option is deprecated. Use digest-algorithms instead.

           Display a list of message digest commands, which are typically used
           as input to the openssl-dgst(1) or openssl-speed(1) commands.

       -cipher-commands
           This option is deprecated. Use cipher-algorithms instead.

           Display a list of cipher commands, which are typically used as
           input to the openssl-enc(1) or openssl-speed(1) commands.

       -digest-algorithms, -kdf-algorithms, -mac-algorithms,
       -cipher-algorithms
           Display a list of cipher, digest, kdf and mac algorithms.  See
           "Display of algorithm names" for a description of how names are
           displayed.

           In verbose mode, the algorithms provided by a provider will get
           additional information on what parameters each implementation
           supports.

       -random-instances
           List the primary, public and private random number generator
           details.

       -random-generators
           Display a list of random number generators.  See "Display of
           algorithm names" for a description of how names are displayed.

       -encoders
           Display a list of encoders.  See "Display of algorithm names" for a
           description of how names are displayed.

           In verbose mode, the algorithms provided by a provider will get
           additional information on what parameters each implementation
           supports.

       -decoders
           Display a list of decoders.  See "Display of algorithm names" for a
           description of how names are displayed.

           In verbose mode, the algorithms provided by a provider will get
           additional information on what parameters each implementation
           supports.

       -public-key-algorithms
           Display a list of public key algorithms, with each algorithm as a
           block of multiple lines, all but the first are indented.  The
           options key-exchange-algorithms, kem-algorithms, signature-
           algorithms, and asymcipher-algorithms will display similar info.

       -public-key-methods
           Display a list of public key methods.

       -key-managers
           Display a list of key managers.

       -key-exchange-algorithms
           Display a list of key exchange algorithms.

       -kem-algorithms
           Display a list of key encapsulation algorithms.

       -signature-algorithms
           Display a list of signature algorithms.

       -asymcipher-algorithms
           Display a list of asymmetric cipher algorithms.

       -store-loaders
           Display a list of store loaders.

       -providers
           Display a list of all loaded providers with their names, version
           and status.

           In verbose mode, the full version and all provider parameters will
           additionally be displayed.

       -engines
           This option is deprecated.

           Display a list of loaded engines.

       -disabled
           Display a list of disabled features, those that were compiled out
           of the installation.

       -objects
           Display a list of built in objects, i.e. OIDs with names.  They're
           listed in the format described in "ASN1 Object Configuration
           Module" in config(5).

       -options command
           Output a two-column list of the options accepted by the specified
           command.  The first is the option name, and the second is a one-
           character indication of what type of parameter it takes, if any.
           This is an internal option, used for checking that the
           documentation is complete.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

   Display of algorithm names
       Algorithm names may be displayed in one of two manners:

       Legacy implementations
           Legacy implementations will simply display the main name of the
           algorithm on a line of its own, or in the form "<foo " bar>> to
           show that "foo" is an alias for the main name, "bar"

       Provided implementations
           Implementations from a provider are displayed like this if the
           implementation is labeled with a single name:

            foo @ bar

           or like this if it's labeled with multiple names:

            { foo1, foo2 } @bar

           In both cases, "bar" is the name of the provider.

HISTORY
       The -engines, -digest-commands, and -cipher-commands options were
       deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
