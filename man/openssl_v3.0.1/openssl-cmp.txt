DESCRIPTION
       The cmp command is a client implementation for the Certificate
       Management Protocol (CMP) as defined in RFC4210.  It can be used to
       request certificates from a CA server, update their certificates,
       request certificates to be revoked, and perform other types of CMP
       requests.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Display a summary of all options

       -config filename
           Configuration file to use.  An empty string "" means none.  Default
           filename is from the environment variable "OPENSSL_CONF".

       -section names
           Section(s) to use within config file defining CMP options.  An
           empty string "" means no specific section.  Default is "cmp".

           Multiple section names may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...").  Contents of sections named later may override
           contents of sections named before.  In any case, as usual, the
           "[default]" section and finally the unnamed section (as far as
           present) can provide per-option fallback values.

       -verbosity level
           Level of verbosity for logging, error output, etc.  0 = EMERG, 1 =
           ALERT, 2 = CRIT, 3 = ERR, 4 = WARN, 5 = NOTE, 6 = INFO, 7 = DEBUG,
           8 = TRACE.  Defaults to 6 = INFO.

   Generic message options
       -cmd ir|cr|kur|p10cr|rr|genm
           CMP command to execute.  Currently implemented commands are:

           ir    - Initialization Request
           cr    - Certificate Request
           p10cr - PKCS#10 Certification Request (for legacy support)
           kur   - Key Update Request
           rr    - Revocation Request
           genm  - General Message

           ir requests initialization of an end entity into a PKI hierarchy by
           issuing a first certificate.

           cr requests issuing an additional certificate for an end entity
           already initialized to the PKI hierarchy.

           p10cr requests issuing an additional certificate similarly to cr
           but using legacy PKCS#10 CSR format.

           kur requests a (key) update for an existing certificate.

           rr requests revocation of an existing certificate.

           genm requests information using a General Message, where optionally
           included InfoTypeAndValues may be used to state which info is of
           interest.  Upon receipt of the General Response, information about
           all received ITAV infoTypes is printed to stdout.

       -infotype name
           Set InfoType name to use for requesting specific info in genm,
           e.g., "signKeyPairTypes".

       -geninfo OID:int:N
           generalInfo integer values to place in request PKIHeader with given
           OID, e.g., "1.2.3.4:int:56789".

   Certificate enrollment options
       -newkey filename|uri
           The source of the private or public key for the certificate
           requested in Initialization Request (IR), Certification
           Request(CR), or Key Update Request (KUR).  Default is the public
           key in the PKCS#10 CSR given with the -csr option, if any, or else
           the current client key, if given.

       -newkeypass arg
           Pass phrase source for the key given with the -newkey option.  If
           not given here, the password will be prompted for if needed.

           For more information about the format of arg see
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -subject name
           X509 Distinguished Name (DN) of subject to use in the requested
           certificate template.  For KUR, it defaults to the public key in
           the PKCS#10 CSR given with the -csr option, if provided, or of the
           reference certificate (see -oldcert) if provided.  This default is
           used for IR and CR only if no SANs are set.  If the NULL-DN ("/")
           is given then no subject is placed in the template.

           If provided and neither -cert nor -oldcert is given, the subject DN
           is used as fallback sender of outgoing CMP messages.

           The argument must be formatted as
           /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=....  Special characters may be
           escaped by "\" (backslash); whitespace is retained.  Empty values
           are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included.
           Giving a single "/" will lead to an empty sequence of RDNs (a NULL-
           DN).  Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a "+" character
           instead of a "/" between the AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that
           specify the members of the set.  Example:

           "/DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe"

       -issuer name
           X509 issuer Distinguished Name (DN) of the CA server to place in
           the requested certificate template in IR/CR/KUR.  If the NULL-DN
           ("/") is given then no issuer is placed in the template.

           If provided and neither -recipient nor -srvcert is given, the
           issuer DN is used as fallback recipient of outgoing CMP messages.

           The argument must be formatted as
           /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=....  For details see the
           description of the -subject option.

       -days number
           Number of days the new certificate is requested to be valid for,
           counting from the current time of the host.  Also triggers the
           explicit request that the validity period starts from the current
           time (as seen by the host).

       -reqexts name
           Name of section in OpenSSL config file defining certificate request
           extensions.  If the -csr option is present, these extensions
           augment the extensions contained the given PKCS#10 CSR, overriding
           any extensions with same OIDs.

       -sans spec
           One or more IP addresses, DNS names, or URIs separated by commas or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...")  to add as Subject Alternative Name(s) (SAN)
           certificate request extension.  If the special element "critical"
           is given the SANs are flagged as critical.  Cannot be used if any
           Subject Alternative Name extension is set via -reqexts.

       -san_nodefault
           When Subject Alternative Names are not given via -sans nor defined
           via -reqexts, they are copied by default from the reference
           certificate (see -oldcert).  This can be disabled by giving the
           -san_nodefault option.

       -policies name
           Name of section in OpenSSL config file defining policies to be set
           as certificate request extension.  This option cannot be used
           together with -policy_oids.

       -policy_oids names
           One or more OID(s), separated by commas and/or whitespace (where in
           the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...")  to
           add as certificate policies request extension.  This option cannot
           be used together with -policies.

       -policy_oids_critical
           Flag the policies given with -policy_oids as critical.

       -popo number
           Proof-of-Possession (POPO) method to use for IR/CR/KUR; values:
           "-1"..<2> where "-1" = NONE, 0 = RAVERIFIED, 1 = SIGNATURE
           (default), 2 = KEYENC.

           Note that a signature-based POPO can only be produced if a private
           key is provided via the -newkey or -key options.

       -csr filename
           PKCS#10 CSR in PEM or DER format containing a certificate request.
           With -cmd p10cr it is used directly in a legacy P10CR message.
           When used with -cmd ir, cr, or kur, it is transformed into the
           respective regular CMP request.  It may also be used with -cmd rr
           to specify the certificate to be revoked via the included subject
           name and public key.

       -out_trusted filenames|uris
           Trusted certificate(s) to use for validating the newly enrolled
           certificate.

           Multiple sources may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...").  Each source may contain multiple certificates.

           The certificate verification options -verify_hostname, -verify_ip,
           and -verify_email only affect the certificate verification enabled
           via this option.

       -implicit_confirm
           Request implicit confirmation of newly enrolled certificates.

       -disable_confirm
           Do not send certificate confirmation message for newly enrolled
           certificate without requesting implicit confirmation to cope with
           broken servers not supporting implicit confirmation correctly.
           WARNING: This leads to behavior violating RFC 4210.

       -certout filename
           The file where the newly enrolled certificate should be saved.

       -chainout filename
           The file where the chain of the newly enrolled certificate should
           be saved.

   Certificate enrollment and revocation options
       -oldcert filename|uri
           The certificate to be updated (i.e., renewed or re-keyed) in Key
           Update Request (KUR) messages or to be revoked in Revocation
           Request (RR) messages.  For KUR the certificate to be updated
           defaults to -cert, and the resulting certificate is called
           reference certificate.  For RR the certificate to be revoked can
           also be specified using -csr.

           The reference certificate, if any, is also used for deriving
           default subject DN and Subject Alternative Names and the default
           issuer entry in the requested certificate template of an IR/CR/KUR.
           Its subject is used as sender of outgoing messages if -cert is not
           given.  Its issuer is used as default recipient in CMP message
           headers if neither -recipient, -srvcert, nor -issuer is given.

       -revreason number
           Set CRLReason to be included in revocation request (RR); values:
           0..10 or "-1" for none (which is the default).

           Reason numbers defined in RFC 5280 are:

              CRLReason ::= ENUMERATED {
                   unspecified             (0),
                   keyCompromise           (1),
                   cACompromise            (2),
                   affiliationChanged      (3),
                   superseded              (4),
                   cessationOfOperation    (5),
                   certificateHold         (6),
                   -- value 7 is not used
                   removeFromCRL           (8),
                   privilegeWithdrawn      (9),
                   aACompromise           (10)
               }

   Message transfer options
       -server [http[s]://][userinfo@]host[:port][/path][?query][#fragment]
           The IP address or DNS hostname and optionally port of the CMP
           server to connect to using HTTP(S) transport.  The scheme "https"
           may be given only if the -tls_used option is used.  In this case
           the default port is 443, else 80.  The optional userinfo and
           fragment components are ignored.  Any given query component is
           handled as part of the path component.  If a path is included it
           provides the default value for the -path option.

       -proxy [http[s]://][userinfo@]host[:port][/path][?query][#fragment]
           The HTTP(S) proxy server to use for reaching the CMP server unless
           -no_proxy applies, see below.  The proxy port defaults to 80 or 443
           if the scheme is "https"; apart from that the optional "http://" or
           "https://" prefix is ignored (note that TLS may be selected by
           -tls_used), as well as any path, userinfo, and query, and fragment
           components.  Defaults to the environment variable "http_proxy" if
           set, else "HTTP_PROXY" in case no TLS is used, otherwise
           "https_proxy" if set, else "HTTPS_PROXY".

       -no_proxy addresses
           List of IP addresses and/or DNS names of servers not to use an
           HTTP(S) proxy for, separated by commas and/or whitespace (where in
           the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
           Default is from the environment variable "no_proxy" if set, else
           "NO_PROXY".

       -recipient name
           Distinguished Name (DN) to use in the recipient field of CMP
           request message headers, i.e., the CMP server (usually the
           addressed CA).

           The recipient field in the header of a CMP message is mandatory.
           If not given explicitly the recipient is determined in the
           following order: the subject of the CMP server certificate given
           with the -srvcert option, the -issuer option, the issuer of the
           certificate given with the -oldcert option, the issuer of the CMP
           client certificate (-cert option), as far as any of those is
           present, else the NULL-DN as last resort.

           The argument must be formatted as
           /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=....  For details see the
           description of the -subject option.

       -path remote_path
           HTTP path at the CMP server (aka CMP alias) to use for POST
           requests.  Defaults to any path given with -server, else "/".

       -keep_alive value
           If the given value is 0 then HTTP connections are not kept open
           after receiving a response, which is the default behavior for HTTP
           1.0.  If the value is 1 or 2 then persistent connections are
           requested.  If the value is 2 then persistent connections are
           required, i.e., in case the server does not grant them an error
           occurs.  The default value is 1, which means preferring to keep the
           connection open.

       -msg_timeout seconds
           Number of seconds (or 0 for infinite) a CMP request-response
           message round trip is allowed to take before a timeout error is
           returned.  Default is to use the -total_timeout setting.

       -total_timeout seconds
           Maximum number seconds an overall enrollment transaction may take,
           including attempts polling for certificates on "waiting" PKIStatus.
           Default is 0 (infinite).

   Server authentication options
       -trusted filenames|uris
           When validating signature-based protection of CMP response
           messages, these are the CA certificate(s) to trust while checking
           certificate chains during CMP server authentication.  This option
           gives more flexibility than the -srvcert option because the server-
           side CMP signer certificate is not pinned but may be any
           certificate for which a chain to one of the given trusted
           certificates can be constructed.

           If no -trusted, -srvcert, and -secret option is given then
           protected response messages from the server are not authenticated.

           Multiple sources may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...").  Each source may contain multiple certificates.

           The certificate verification options -verify_hostname, -verify_ip,
           and -verify_email have no effect on the certificate verification
           enabled via this option.

       -untrusted filenames|uris
           Non-trusted intermediate CA certificate(s).  Any extra certificates
           given with the -cert option are appended to it.  All these
           certificates may be useful for cert path construction for the CMP
           client certificate (to include in the extraCerts field of outgoing
           messages) and for the TLS client certificate (if TLS is enabled) as
           well as for chain building when validating the CMP server
           certificate (checking signature-based CMP message protection) and
           when validating newly enrolled certificates.

           Multiple sources may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace.  Each file may contain multiple certificates.

       -srvcert filename|uri
           The specific CMP server certificate to expect and directly trust
           (even if it is expired) when validating signature-based protection
           of CMP response messages.  May be set alternatively to the -trusted
           option to pin the accepted server.

           If set, the subject of the certificate is also used as default
           value for the recipient of CMP requests and as default value for
           the expected sender of incoming CMP messages.

       -expect_sender name
           Distinguished Name (DN) expected in the sender field of incoming
           CMP messages.  Defaults to the subject DN of the pinned -srvcert,
           if any.

           This can be used to make sure that only a particular entity is
           accepted as CMP message signer, and attackers are not able to use
           arbitrary certificates of a trusted PKI hierarchy to fraudulently
           pose as a CMP server.  Note that this option gives slightly more
           freedom than setting the -srvcert, which pins the server to the
           holder of a particular certificate, while the expected sender name
           will continue to match after updates of the server cert.

           The argument must be formatted as
           /type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=....  For details see the
           description of the -subject option.

       -ignore_keyusage
           Ignore key usage restrictions in CMP signer certificates when
           validating signature-based protection of incoming CMP messages,
           else "digitalSignature" must be allowed for signer certificate.

       -unprotected_errors
           Accept missing or invalid protection of negative responses from the
           server.  This applies to the following message types and contents:

           •   error messages

           •   negative certificate responses (IP/CP/KUP)

           •   negative revocation responses (RP)

           •   negative PKIConf messages

           WARNING: This setting leads to unspecified behavior and it is meant
           exclusively to allow interoperability with server implementations
           violating RFC 4210, e.g.:

           •   section 5.1.3.1 allows exceptions from protecting only for
               special cases: "There MAY be cases in which the PKIProtection
               BIT STRING is deliberately not used to protect a message [...]
               because other protection, external to PKIX, will be applied
               instead."

           •   section 5.3.21 is clear on ErrMsgContent: "The CA MUST always
               sign it with a signature key."

           •   appendix D.4 shows PKIConf message having protection

       -extracertsout filename
           The file where to save all certificates contained in the extraCerts
           field of the last received response message (except for pollRep and
           PKIConf).

       -cacertsout filename
           The file where to save any CA certificates contained in the caPubs
           field of the last received certificate response (i.e., IP, CP, or
           KUP) message.

   Client authentication options
       -ref value
           Reference number/string/value to use as fallback senderKID; this is
           required if no sender name can be determined from the -cert or
           <-subject> options and is typically used when authenticating with
           pre-shared key (password-based MAC).

       -secret arg
           Prefer PBM-based message protection with given source of a secret
           value.  The secret is used for creating PBM-based protection of
           outgoing messages and (as far as needed) for validating PBM-based
           protection of incoming messages.  PBM stands for Password-Based
           Message Authentication Code.  This takes precedence over the -cert
           and -key options.

           For more information about the format of arg see
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -cert filename|uri
           The client's current CMP signer certificate.  Requires the
           corresponding key to be given with -key.  The subject of this
           certificate will be used as sender of outgoing CMP messages, while
           the subject of -oldcert or -subjectName may provide fallback
           values.  The issuer of this certificate is used as one of the
           recipient fallback values and as fallback issuer entry in the
           certificate template of IR/CR/KUR.  When using signature-based
           message protection, this "protection certificate" will be included
           first in the extraCerts field of outgoing messages and the
           signature is done with the corresponding key.  In Initialization
           Request (IR) messages this can be used for authenticating using an
           external entity certificate as defined in appendix E.7 of RFC 4210.
           For Key Update Request (KUR) messages this is also used as the
           certificate to be updated if the -oldcert option is not given.  If
           the file includes further certs, they are appended to the untrusted
           certs because they typically constitute the chain of the client
           certificate, which is included in the extraCerts field in
           signature-protected request messages.

       -own_trusted filenames|uris
           If this list of certificates is provided then the chain built for
           the client-side CMP signer certificate given with the -cert option
           is verified using the given certificates as trust anchors.

           Multiple sources may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...").  Each source may contain multiple certificates.

           The certificate verification options -verify_hostname, -verify_ip,
           and -verify_email have no effect on the certificate verification
           enabled via this option.

       -key filename|uri
           The corresponding private key file for the client's current
           certificate given in the -cert option.  This will be used for
           signature-based message protection unless the -secret option
           indicating PBM or -unprotected_requests is given.

       -keypass arg
           Pass phrase source for the private key given with the -key option.
           Also used for -cert and -oldcert in case it is an encrypted PKCS#12
           file.  If not given here, the password will be prompted for if
           needed.

           For more information about the format of arg see
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -digest name
           Specifies name of supported digest to use in RFC 4210's MSG_SIG_ALG
           and as the one-way function (OWF) in MSG_MAC_ALG.  If applicable,
           this is used for message protection and Proof-of-Possession (POPO)
           signatures.  To see the list of supported digests, use "openssl
           list -digest-commands".  Defaults to "sha256".

       -mac name
           Specifies the name of the MAC algorithm in MSG_MAC_ALG.  To get the
           names of supported MAC algorithms use "openssl list
           -mac-algorithms" and possibly combine such a name with the name of
           a supported digest algorithm, e.g., hmacWithSHA256.  Defaults to
           "hmac-sha1" as per RFC 4210.

       -extracerts filenames|uris
           Certificates to append in the extraCerts field when sending
           messages.  They can be used as the default CMP signer certificate
           chain to include.

           Multiple sources may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...").  Each source may contain multiple certificates.

       -unprotected_requests
           Send messages without CMP-level protection.

   Credentials format options
       -certform PEM|DER
           File format to use when saving a certificate to a file.  Default
           value is PEM.

       -keyform PEM|DER|P12|ENGINE
           The format of the key input; unspecified by default.  See "Format
           Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -otherpass arg
           Pass phrase source for certificate given with the -trusted,
           -untrusted, -own_trusted, -srvcert, -out_trusted, -extracerts,
           -srv_trusted, -srv_untrusted, -rsp_extracerts, -rsp_capubs,
           -tls_extra, and -tls_trusted options.  If not given here, the
           password will be prompted for if needed.

           For more information about the format of arg see
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

           As an alternative to using this combination:

               -engine {engineid} -key {keyid} -keyform ENGINE

           ... it's also possible to just give the key ID in URI form to -key,
           like this:

               -key org.openssl.engine:{engineid}:{keyid}

           This applies to all options specifying keys: -key, -newkey, and
           -tls_key.

   Provider options

       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

   Random state options
       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

   TLS connection options
       -tls_used
           Enable using TLS (even when other TLS_related options are not set)
           when connecting to CMP server.

       -tls_cert filename|uri
           Client's TLS certificate.  If the source includes further certs
           they are used (along with -untrusted certs) for constructing the
           client cert chain provided to the TLS server.

       -tls_key filename|uri
           Private key for the client's TLS certificate.

       -tls_keypass arg
           Pass phrase source for client's private TLS key -tls_key.  Also
           used for -tls_cert in case it is an encrypted PKCS#12 file.  If not
           given here, the password will be prompted for if needed.

           For more information about the format of arg see
           openssl-passphrase-options(1).

           Extra certificates to provide to TLS server during TLS handshake

       -tls_trusted filenames|uris
           Trusted certificate(s) to use for validating the TLS server
           certificate.  This implies hostname validation.

           Multiple sources may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...").  Each source may contain multiple certificates.

           The certificate verification options -verify_hostname, -verify_ip,
           and -verify_email have no effect on the certificate verification
           enabled via this option.

       -tls_host name
           Address to be checked during hostname validation.  This may be a
           DNS name or an IP address.  If not given it defaults to the -server
           address.

   Client-side debugging options
       -batch
           Do not interactively prompt for input, for instance when a password
           is needed.  This can be useful for batch processing and testing.

       -repeat number
           Invoke the command the given positive number of times with the same
           parameters.  Default is one invocation.

       -reqin filenames
           Take sequence of CMP requests from file(s).

           Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace (where in the latter case the whole argument must be
           enclosed in "...").  As many files are read as needed for a
           complete transaction.

       -reqin_new_tid
           Use a fresh transactionID for CMP request messages read using
           -reqin, which requires re-protecting them as far as they were
           protected before.  This may be needed in case the sequence of
           requests is reused and the CMP server complains that the
           transaction ID has already been used.

       -reqout filenames
           Save sequence of CMP requests to file(s).

           Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or

           complete transaction.

       -rspin filenames
           Process sequence of CMP responses provided in file(s), skipping
           server.

           Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or

           transaction.

       -rspout filenames
           Save sequence of CMP responses to file(s).

           Multiple filenames may be given, separated by commas and/or
           whitespace.  As many files are written as needed to store the
           complete transaction.

       -use_mock_srv
           Use the internal mock server for testing the client.  This works at
           API level, bypassing HTTP transport.

   Mock server options

       -max_msgs number
           Maximum number of CMP (request) messages the CMP HTTP server mock-
           up should handle, which must be nonnegative.  The default value is
           0, which means that no limit is imposed.  In any case the server
           terminates on internal errors, but not when it detects a CMP-level
           error that it can successfully answer with an error message.

       -srv_ref value
           Reference value to use as senderKID of server in case no -srv_cert
           is given.

           Trusted certificates for client authentication.

           The certificate verification options -verify_hostname, -verify_ip,
           and -verify_email have no effect on the certificate verification
           enabled via this option.

       -srv_untrusted filenames|uris

           CA certificates to be included in mock Initialization Response (IP)
           message.

       -poll_count number
           Number of times the client must poll before receiving a
           certificate.

       server response. Valid range is 0 .. 2^27 - 1.
       -statusstring arg
           Text to be included as status string in server response.

       -send_error
           Force server to reply with error message.

           Set various options of certificate chain verification.  See
           "Verification Options" in openssl-verification-options(1) for
           details.

           The certificate verification options -verify_hostname, -verify_ip,
           and -verify_email only affect the certificate verification enabled
           via the -out_trusted option.

NOTES
       When setting up CMP configurations and experimenting with enrollment
       options typically various errors occur until the configuration is
       correct and complete.  When the CMP server reports an error the client
       will by default check the protection of the CMP response message.  Yet
       some CMP services tend not to protect negative responses.  In this case
       the client will reject them, and thus their contents are not shown
       although they usually contain hints that would be helpful for
       diagnostics.  For assisting in such cases the CMP client offers a
       workaround via the -unprotected_errors option, which allows accepting
       such negative messages.

EXAMPLES
   Simple examples using the default OpenSSL configuration file
       This CMP client implementation comes with demonstrative CMP sections in
       the example configuration file openssl/apps/openssl.cnf, which can be
       used to interact conveniently with the Insta Demo CA.

       In order to enroll an initial certificate from that CA it is sufficient
       to issue the following shell commands.

         export OPENSSL_CONF=/path/to/openssl/apps/openssl.cnf

         openssl genrsa -out insta.priv.pem
         openssl cmp -section insta

       This should produce the file insta.cert.pem containing a new
       certificate for the private key held in insta.priv.pem.  It can be
       viewed using, e.g.,

         openssl x509 -noout -text -in insta.cert.pem

       In case the network setup requires using an HTTP proxy it may be given
       as usual via the environment variable http_proxy or via the -proxy
       option in the configuration file or the CMP command-line argument
       -proxy, for example

         -proxy http://192.168.1.1:8080

       In the Insta Demo CA scenario both clients and the server may use the
       pre-shared secret insta and the reference value 3078 to authenticate to
       each other.

       Alternatively, CMP messages may be protected in signature-based manner,
       where the trust anchor in this case is insta.ca.crt and the client may
       use any certificate already obtained from that CA, as specified in the
       [signature] section of the example configuration.  This can be used in
       combination with the [insta] section simply by

         openssl cmp -section insta,signature

       By default the CMP IR message type is used, yet CR works equally here.
       This may be specified directly at the command line:

         openssl cmp -section insta -cmd cr

       or by referencing in addition the [cr] section of the example
       configuration:

         openssl cmp -section insta,cr

       In order to update the enrolled certificate one may call

         openssl cmp -section insta,kur

       using with PBM-based protection or

         openssl cmp -section insta,kur,signature

       using signature-based protection.

       In a similar way any previously enrolled certificate may be revoked by

         openssl cmp -section insta,rr -trusted insta.ca.crt

       or

         openssl cmp -section insta,rr,signature

       Many more options can be given in the configuration file and/or on the
       command line.  For instance, the -reqexts CLI option may refer to a
       section in the configuration file defining X.509 extensions to use in
       certificate requests, such as "v3_req" in openssl/apps/openssl.cnf:

         openssl cmp -section insta,cr -reqexts v3_req

   Certificate enrollment
       The following examples do not make use of a configuration file at
       first.  They assume that a CMP server can be contacted on the local TCP
       port 80 and accepts requests under the alias /pkix/.

       For enrolling its very first certificate the client generates a client
       key and sends an initial request message to the local CMP server using
       a pre-shared secret key for mutual authentication.  In this example the
       client does not have the CA certificate yet, so we specify the name of
       the CA with the -recipient option and save any CA certificates that we
       may receive in the "capubs.pem" file.

       In below command line usage examples the "\" at line ends is used just
       for formatting; each of the command invocations should be on a single
       line.

         openssl genrsa -out cl_key.pem
         openssl cmp -cmd ir -server 127.0.0.1:80/pkix/ -recipient "/CN=CMPserver" \
           -ref 1234 -secret pass:1234-5678 \
           -newkey cl_key.pem -subject "/CN=MyName" \
           -cacertsout capubs.pem -certout cl_cert.pem

   Certificate update
       Then, when the client certificate and its related key pair needs to be
       updated, the client can send a key update request taking the certs in
       "capubs.pem" as trusted for authenticating the server and using the
       previous cert and key for its own authentication.  Then it can start
       using the new cert and key.

         openssl genrsa -out cl_key_new.pem
         openssl cmp -cmd kur -server 127.0.0.1:80/pkix/ \
           -trusted capubs.pem \
           -cert cl_cert.pem -key cl_key.pem \
           -newkey cl_key_new.pem -certout cl_cert.pem
         cp cl_key_new.pem cl_key.pem

       This command sequence can be repated as often as needed.

   Requesting information from CMP server

         openssl cmp -cmd genm -server 127.0.0.1/pkix/ -recipient "/CN=CMPserver" \
           -ref 1234 -secret pass:1234-5678

   Using a custom configuration file
       For CMP client invocations, in particular for certificate enrollment,
       usually many parameters need to be set, which is tedious and error-
       prone to do on the command line.  Therefore, the client offers the
       possibility to read options from sections of the OpenSSL config file,
       usually called openssl.cnf.  The values found there can still be
       extended and even overridden by any subsequently loaded sections and on
       the command line.

       After including in the configuration file the following sections:

         [cmp]
         server = 127.0.0.1
         path = pkix/
         trusted = capubs.pem
         cert = cl_cert.pem
         key = cl_key.pem
         newkey = cl_key.pem
         certout = cl_cert.pem

         [init]
         recipient = "/CN=CMPserver"
         trusted =
         cert =
         key =
         ref = 1234
         secret = pass:1234-5678-1234-567
         subject = "/CN=MyName"
         cacertsout = capubs.pem

       the above enrollment transactions reduce to

         openssl cmp -section cmp,init
         openssl cmp -cmd kur -newkey cl_key_new.pem

       and the above transaction using a general message reduces to

         openssl cmp -section cmp,init -cmd genm
