OPENSSL-PKCS7(1ossl)                OpenSSL               OPENSSL-PKCS7(1ossl)



NAME
       openssl-pkcs7 - PKCS#7 command

SYNOPSIS
       openssl pkcs7 [-help] [-inform DER|PEM] [-outform DER|PEM] [-in
       filename] [-out filename] [-print] [-print_certs] [-text] [-noout]
       [-engine id] [-provider name] [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq]

DESCRIPTION
       This command processes PKCS#7 files.  Note that it only understands
       PKCS#7 v 1.5 as specified in IETF RFC 2315.  It cannot currently parse
       CMS as described in IETF RFC 2630.

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -inform DER|PEM, -outform DER|PEM
           The input and formats; the default is PEM.  See
           openssl-format-options(1) for details.

           The data is a PKCS#7 Version 1.5 structure.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read from or standard input if
           this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           Specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
           default.

       -print
           Print out the full PKCS7 object.

       -print_certs
           Prints out any certificates or CRLs contained in the file. They are
           preceded by their subject and issuer names in one line format.

       -text
           Prints out certificate details in full rather than just subject and
           issuer names.

       -noout
           Don't output the encoded version of the PKCS#7 structure (or
           certificates if -print_certs is set).

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
           See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

EXAMPLES
       Convert a PKCS#7 file from PEM to DER:

        openssl pkcs7 -in file.pem -outform DER -out file.der

       Output all certificates in a file:

        openssl pkcs7 -in file.pem -print_certs -out certs.pem
