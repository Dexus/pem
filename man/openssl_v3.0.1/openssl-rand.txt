OPENSSL-RAND(1ossl)                 OpenSSL                OPENSSL-RAND(1ossl)



NAME
       openssl-rand - generate pseudo-random bytes

SYNOPSIS
       openssl rand [-help] [-out file] [-base64] [-hex] [-engine id] [-rand
       files] [-writerand file] [-provider name] [-provider-path path]
       [-propquery propq] num

DESCRIPTION
       This command generates num random bytes using a cryptographically
       secure pseudo random number generator (CSPRNG).

       The random bytes are generated using the RAND_bytes(3) function, which
       provides a security level of 256 bits, provided it managed to seed
       itself successfully from a trusted operating system entropy source.
       Otherwise, the command will fail with a nonzero error code.  For more
       details, see RAND_bytes(3), RAND(7), and EVP_RAND(7).

OPTIONS
       -help
           Print out a usage message.

       -out file
           Write to file instead of standard output.

       -base64
           Perform base64 encoding on the output.

       -hex
           Show the output as a hex string.

       -engine id
           See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).  This option is deprecated.

       -rand files, -writerand file
           See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.
