NAME
       openssl-srp - maintain SRP password file

SYNOPSIS
       openssl srp [-help] [-verbose] [-add] [-modify] [-delete] [-list]
       [-name section] [-srpvfile file] [-gn identifier] [-userinfo text]
       [-passin arg] [-passout arg] [-engine id] [-rand files] [-writerand
       file] [-provider name] [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq]
       [-config configfile] [user ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is deprecated. It is used to maintain an SRP (secure
       remote password) file. At most one of the -add, -modify, -delete, and
       -list options can be specified.  These options take zero or more
       usernames as parameters and perform the appropriate operation on the
       SRP file.  For -list, if no user is given then all users are displayed.

       The configuration file to use, and the section within the file, can be
       specified with the -config and -name flags, respectively.

       -name

           specify the file to operate on.

       -gn Specifies the g and N values, using one of the strengths defined in
           IETF RFC 5054.
