DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ss__sseerrvveerr command implements a generic SSL/TLS server which listens
       for connections on a given port using SSL/TLS.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aacccceepptt ppoorrtt
           the TCP port to listen on for connections. If not specified 4433 is
           used.

       --ccoonntteexxtt iidd
           sets the SSL context id. It can be given any string value. If this
           option is not present a default value will be used.

       --cceerrtt cceerrttnnaammee
           The certificate to use, most servers cipher suites require the use
           of a certificate and some require a certificate with a certain
           public key type: for example the DSS cipher suites require a
           certificate containing a DSS (DSA) key. If not specified then the
           filename "server.pem" will be used.

       --cceerrttffoorrmm ffoorrmmaatt
           The certificate format to use: DER or PEM. PEM is the default.

       --kkeeyy kkeeyyffiillee
           The private key to use. If not specified then the certificate file
           will be used.

       --kkeeyyffoorrmm ffoorrmmaatt
           The private format to use: DER or PEM. PEM is the default.

       --ppaassss aarrgg
           the private key password source. For more information about the
           format of aarrgg see the PPAASSSS PPHHRRAASSEE AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS section in ooppeennssssll(1).

       --ddcceerrtt ffiilleennaammee, --ddkkeeyy kkeeyynnaammee
           specify an additional certificate and private key, these behave in
           the same manner as the --cceerrtt and --kkeeyy options except there is no
           default if they are not specified (no additional certificate and
           key is used). As noted above some cipher suites require a
           certificate containing a key of a certain type. Some cipher suites
           need a certificate carrying an RSA key and some a DSS (DSA) key. By
           using RSA and DSS certificates and keys a server can support
           clients which only support RSA or DSS cipher suites by using an
           appropriate certificate.

       --ddcceerrttffoorrmm ffoorrmmaatt, --ddkkeeyyffoorrmm ffoorrmmaatt, --ddppaassss aarrgg
           addtional certificate and private key format and passphrase
           respectively.

       --nnoocceerrtt
           if this option is set then no certificate is used. This restricts
           the cipher suites available to the anonymous ones (currently just
           anonymous DH).

       --ddhhppaarraamm ffiilleennaammee
           the DH parameter file to use. The ephemeral DH cipher suites
           generate keys using a set of DH parameters. If not specified then
           an attempt is made to load the parameters from the server
           certificate file. If this fails then a static set of parameters
           hard coded into the s_server program will be used.

       --nnoo__ddhhee
           if this option is set then no DH parameters will be loaded
           effectively disabling the ephemeral DH cipher suites.

       --nnoo__ttmmpp__rrssaa
           certain export cipher suites sometimes use a temporary RSA key,
           this option disables temporary RSA key generation.

       --vveerriiffyy ddeepptthh, --VVeerriiffyy ddeepptthh
           The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length of the
           client certificate chain and makes the server request a certificate
           from the client. With the --vveerriiffyy option a certificate is requested
           but the client does not have to send one, with the --VVeerriiffyy option
           the client must supply a certificate or an error occurs.

           If the ciphersuite cannot request a client certificate (for example
           an anonymous ciphersuite or PSK) this option has no effect.

       --ccrrll__cchheecckk, --ccrrll__cchheecckk__aallll
           Check the peer certificate has not been revoked by its CA.  The
           CRL(s) are appended to the certificate file. With the
           --ccrrll__cchheecckk__aallll option all CRLs of all CAs in the chain are checked.

       --CCAAppaatthh ddiirreeccttoorryy
           The directory to use for client certificate verification. This
           directory must be in "hash format", see vveerriiffyy for more
           information. These are also used when building the server
           certificate chain.

       --CCAAffiillee ffiillee
           A file containing trusted certificates to use during client
           authentication and to use when attempting to build the server
           certificate chain. The list is also used in the list of acceptable
           client CAs passed to the client when a certificate is requested.

       --ssttaattee
           prints out the SSL session states.

       --ddeebbuugg
           print extensive debugging information including a hex dump of all
           traffic.

       --mmssgg
           show all protocol messages with hex dump.

       --nnbbiioo__tteesstt
           tests non blocking I/O

       --nnbbiioo
           turns on non blocking I/O

       --ccrrllff
           this option translated a line feed from the terminal into CR+LF.

       --qquuiieett
           inhibit printing of session and certificate information.

       --ssssll22, --ssssll33, --ttllss11, --nnoo__ssssll22, --nnoo__ssssll33, --nnoo__ttllss11
           these options disable the use of certain SSL or TLS protocols. By
           default the initial handshake uses a method which should be
           compatible with all servers and permit them to use SSL v3, SSL v2
           or TLS as appropriate.

       --bbuuggss
           there are several known bug in SSL and TLS implementations. Adding
           this option enables various workarounds.

       --hhaacckk
           this option enables a further workaround for some some early
           Netscape SSL code (?).

       --cciipphheerr cciipphheerrlliisstt
           this allows the cipher list used by the server to be modified.
           When the client sends a list of supported ciphers the first client
           cipher also included in the server list is used. Because the client
           specifies the preference order, the order of the server cipherlist
           irrelevant. See the cciipphheerrss command for more information.

       --sseerrvveerrpprreeff
           use the server's cipher preferences, rather than the client's
           preferences.

       --ttllsseexxttddeebbuugg
           print out a hex dump of any TLS extensions received from the
           server.

       --nnoo__ttiicckkeett
           disable RFC4507bis session ticket support.

       --wwwwww
           sends a status message back to the client when it connects. This
           includes lots of information about the ciphers used and various
           session parameters.  The output is in HTML format so this option
           will normally be used with a web browser.

       --WWWWWW
           emulates a simple web server. Pages will be resolved relative to
           the current directory, for example if the URL
           https://myhost/page.html is requested the file ./page.html will be
           loaded.

       --HHTTTTPP
           emulates a simple web server. Pages will be resolved relative to
           the current directory, for example if the URL
           https://myhost/page.html is requested the file ./page.html will be
           loaded. The files loaded are assumed to contain a complete and
           correct HTTP response (lines that are part of the HTTP response
           line and headers must end with CRLF).

       --eennggiinnee iidd
           specifying an engine (by it's unique iidd string) will cause ss__sseerrvveerr
           to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified
           engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set
           as the default for all available algorithms.

       --iidd__pprreeffiixx aarrgg
           generate SSL/TLS session IDs prefixed by aarrgg. This is mostly useful
           for testing any SSL/TLS code (eg. proxies) that wish to deal with
           multiple servers, when each of which might be generating a unique
           range of session IDs (eg. with a certain prefix).

       --rraanndd ffiillee((ss))
           a file or files containing random data used to seed the random
           number generator, or an EGD socket (see RRAANNDD__eeggdd(3)).  Multiple
           files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent character.  The
           separator is ;; for MS-Windows, ,, for OpenVMS, and :: for all others.

CCOONNNNEECCTTEEDD CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       If a connection request is established with an SSL client and neither
       the --wwwwww nor the --WWWWWW option has been used then normally any data
       received from the client is displayed and any key presses will be sent
       to the client.

       Certain single letter commands are also recognized which perform
       special operations: these are listed below.

       qq   end the current SSL connection but still accept new connections.

       QQ   end the current SSL connection and exit.

       rr   renegotiate the SSL session.

       RR   renegotiate the SSL session and request a client certificate.

       PP   send some plain text down the underlying TCP connection: this
           should cause the client to disconnect due to a protocol violation.

       SS   print out some session cache status information.

NNOOTTEESS
       ss__sseerrvveerr can be used to debug SSL clients. To accept connections from a
       web browser the command:

        openssl s_server -accept 443 -www

       can be used for example.

       Most web browsers (in particular Netscape and MSIE) only support RSA
       cipher suites, so they cannot connect to servers which don't use a
       certificate carrying an RSA key or a version of OpenSSL with RSA
       disabled.

       Although specifying an empty list of CAs when requesting a client
       certificate is strictly speaking a protocol violation, some SSL clients
       interpret this to mean any CA is acceptable. This is useful for
       debugging purposes.

       The session parameters can printed out using the sseessss__iidd program.

       TLS extensions are only supported in OpenSSL 0.9.8 if they are
       explictly enabled at compile time using for example the eennaabbllee--ttllsseexxtt
       switch.

BBUUGGSS
       Because this program has a lot of options and also because some of the
       techniques used are rather old, the C source of s_server is rather hard
       to read and not a model of how things should be done. A typical SSL
       server program would be much simpler.

       The output of common ciphers is wrong: it just gives the list of
       ciphers that OpenSSL recognizes and the client supports.

       There should be a way for the ss__sseerrvveerr program to print out details of
       any unknown cipher suites a client says it supports.
