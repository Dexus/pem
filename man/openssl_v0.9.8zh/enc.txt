       The symmetric cipher commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted
       using various block and stream ciphers using keys based on passwords or
       explicitly provided. Base64 encoding or decoding can also be performed
       either by itself or in addition to the encryption or decryption.

       --iinn ffiilleennaammee
           the input filename, standard input by default.

       --oouutt ffiilleennaammee
           the output filename, standard output by default.

       --ppaassss aarrgg
           the password source. For more information about the format of aarrgg
           see the PPAASSSS PPHHRRAASSEE AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS section in ooppeennssssll(1).

       --ssaalltt
           use a salt in the key derivation routines. This is the default.

       --nnoossaalltt
           don't use a salt in the key derivation routines. This option SSHHOOUULLDD
           NNOOTT be used except for test purposes or compatibility with ancient
           versions of OpenSSL and SSLeay.

       --ee  encrypt the input data: this is the default.

       --dd  decrypt the input data.

       --aa  base64 process the data. This means that if encryption is taking
           place the data is base64 encoded after encryption. If decryption is
           set then the input data is base64 decoded before being decrypted.

       --AA  if the --aa option is set then base64 process the data on one line.

       --kk ppaasssswwoorrdd
           the password to derive the key from. This is for compatibility with
           previous versions of OpenSSL. Superseded by the --ppaassss argument.

       --kkffiillee ffiilleennaammee
           read the password to derive the key from the first line of
           ffiilleennaammee.  This is for compatibility with previous versions of
           OpenSSL. Superseded by the --ppaassss argument.

       --SS ssaalltt
           the actual salt to use: this must be represented as a string
           comprised only of hex digits.

       --KK kkeeyy
           the actual key to use: this must be represented as a string
           comprised only of hex digits. If only the key is specified, the IV
           must additionally specified using the --iivv option. When both a key
           and a password are specified, the key given with the --KK option will
           be used and the IV generated from the password will be taken. It
           probably does not make much sense to specify both key and password.

       --iivv IIVV
           the actual IV to use: this must be represented as a string
           comprised only of hex digits. When only the key is specified using
           the --KK option, the IV must explicitly be defined. When a password
           is being specified using one of the other options, the IV is
           generated from this password.

       --pp  print out the key and IV used.

       --PP  print out the key and IV used then immediately exit: don't do any
           encryption or decryption.

       --bbuuffssiizzee nnuummbbeerr
           set the buffer size for I/O

       --nnooppaadd
           disable standard block padding

       --ddeebbuugg
           debug the BIOs used for I/O.

NNOOTTEESS
       The program can be called either as ooppeennssssll cciipphheerrnnaammee or ooppeennssssll eenncc
       --cciipphheerrnnaammee.

       A password will be prompted for to derive the key and IV if necessary.

       The --ssaalltt option should AALLWWAAYYSS be used if the key is being derived from
       a password unless you want compatibility with previous versions of
       OpenSSL and SSLeay.

       Without the --ssaalltt option it is possible to perform efficient dictionary
       attacks on the password and to attack stream cipher encrypted data. The
       reason for this is that without the salt the same password always
       generates the same encryption key. When the salt is being used the
       first eight bytes of the encrypted data are reserved for the salt: it
       is generated at random when encrypting a file and read from the
       encrypted file when it is decrypted.

       Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security
       implications if not used correctly. A beginner is advised to just use a
       strong block cipher in CBC mode such as bf or des3.

       All the block ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding also known as
       standard block padding: this allows a rudimentary integrity or password
       check to be performed. However since the chance of random data passing
       the test is better than 1 in 256 it isn't a very good test.

       If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the
       cipher block length.

       All RC2 ciphers have the same key and effective key length.

       Blowfish and RC5 algorithms use a 128 bit key.

BBUUGGSS
       The --AA option when used with large files doesn't work properly.

       There should be an option to allow an iteration count to be included.

       The eenncc program only supports a fixed number of algorithms with certain
       parameters. So if, for example, you want to use RC2 with a 76 bit key
       or RC4 with an 84 bit key you can't use this program.
